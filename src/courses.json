A formal program in American studies was established in 1968, and exciting additions in American Indian and indigenous studies, Southern studies, and global American studies have been added in the past two decades. The Department of American Studies has a tradition of vigorous teaching and an innovative curriculum that offers stimulating opportunities to study the United States and the diversity and influence of its peoples, institutions, texts, performances, and places. In addition, each of our areas of major concentration incorporates global and comparative perspectives. The department’s commitment to interdisciplinary approaches empowers students to value the nation’s complexity by engaging with a variety of historical, literary, artistic, political, social, cultural, legal, racial, ethnic, and ethnographic perspectives within and beyond the United States. American studies majors graduate with a comprehension of the dynamics of American culture that prepares them to make a responsible and critical difference in the variety of professions they choose to pursue.  The American studies major offers five areas of concentration, each with its own distinct degree requirements.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors and minors by appointment. Further information on courses, opportunities, and honors theses may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  American studies is an excellent liberal arts major for students interested in graduate and professional school study. The major prepares students for graduate work in fields such as American history and literature. After receiving the baccalaureate degree, American studies majors consistently have been accepted in law and business schools, which are interested in students with a broad, interdisciplinary undergraduate background. American studies provides a solid basis for a variety of career choices, including public service, business, teaching, museum curation, and journalism. The folklore concentration and minor are a productive component of study for those preparing for graduate school in anthropology, communication, journalism, music, and folklore itself,  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            117  as well as for those planning careers in museum curation, public arts presentation, and music production.

AMST 396, FOLK 490, and FOLK 690 may fall under various categories, depending on the focus of these courses in a given semester; the course instructor and director of undergraduate studies will decide which category they fulfill.  At the core of the undergraduate major concentration in American studies are two required courses in interdisciplinary cultural analysis (see above). Majors also choose at least two advanced seminars in the department that focus readings and research on topics representative of both the talents of its faculty members and emergent directions in American studies scholarship. For the remainder of their requirements, majors select a series of relevant electives offered by over a dozen different University departments and curricula. These courses deepen majors’ interdisciplinary awareness of American traditions, institutions, literature, and arts as well as expose students to a diversity of American experiences and perspectives. Students may petition the director of undergraduate studies to have courses not listed approved to fulfill major requirements; such courses will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  3 3 3 3  3 3 3  3 3  3 3  4  3 3 3  3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  3 3  3 3  3 3 3  3  3  3 3 3  3  3 3 3 3  \fSpecial Opportunities in American Studies Honors in American Studies The American studies major offers a two-course honors program: AMST 691H in the fall semester and AMST 692H in the spring semester. Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the Department of American Studies during the registration period. During the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest honors. Experiential Education The Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service Learning in America (AMST 398) and offers credits for approved internship projects (AMST 493). Students have learned about American studies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies, and other cultural institutions. Study Abroad The Department of American Studies encourages students to consider a semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations with several American studies programs in different countries. Studying American experience in international contexts is an integral part of understanding the place and influence of the United States in the world. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by examining how American subjects are taught in universities around the globe as well as by encountering the international students who enroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers students of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular and traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local and a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies major credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged to make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad courses can count toward the international American studies major or minor. Students interested in this experience should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or with the Study Abroad Office about international exchange programs sponsored by UNC–Chapel Hill. Undergraduate Awards The department awards Julia Preston Brumley Travel Scholarships to help fund international travel and study abroad. The Peter C. Baxter Memorial Prize is awarded annually to the outstanding senior majoring in American studies. Undergraduate Research The Department offers credit for AMST 396 and FOLK 495. Majors can develop a two-semester honors thesis project (AMST 691H and AMST 692H or FOLK 691H and FOLK 692H) in consultation with an advisor. Students have received summer undergraduate research  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            133  fellowships, earned research support and travel awards, and presented their work at the Annual Celebration of Undergraduate Research each spring.

These realms are often deeply grounded in tradition; this doesn’t mean, however, that they’re always or necessarily old. Just as communities change their own sense of self in response to shifting social, political, and economic realities, so too does the artistry they create evolve. Folklore thus moves beyond the study of the old and time- honored to explore emergent meanings and cultural forms. Trending tweets, food trucks, slam poetry, and hip hop freestyling are just as relevant to folklorists’ study as are string-band tunes, Cherokee quilts, family recipes, and blues. The communities that our students study are equally broad, ranging from Lumbee sheetrock workers and Latino line cooks to urban homesteaders and Black Lives Matter activists. The main way that we explore contemporary folklore, in turn, is ethnographic fieldwork, the real-world study of people’s lives in everyday settings, grounded in conversation and participatory engagement. Students may petition the director of undergraduate studies to have courses not listed approved to fulfill major requirements; such courses will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Special Opportunities in American Studies Honors in American Studies The American studies major offers a two-course honors program: AMST 691H in the fall semester and AMST 692H in the spring semester. Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the Department of American Studies during the registration period. During the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest honors. Experiential Education The Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service Learning in America (AMST 398) and offers credits for approved internship projects (AMST 493). Students have learned about American studies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies, and other cultural institutions. Study Abroad The Department of American Studies encourages students to consider a semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations with several American studies programs in different countries. Studying American experience in international contexts is an integral part of understanding the place and influence of the United States in the world. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by examining how American subjects are taught in universities around the globe as well as by encountering the international students who enroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers students of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular and traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local and a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies major credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged  to make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad courses can count toward the international American studies major or minor. Students interested in this experience should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or with the Study Abroad Office about international exchange programs sponsored by UNC–Chapel Hill. Undergraduate Awards The department awards Julia Preston Brumley Travel Scholarships to help fund international travel and study abroad. The Peter C. Baxter Memorial Prize is awarded annually to the outstanding senior majoring in American studies. Undergraduate Research The Department offers credit for AMST 396 and FOLK 495. Majors can develop a two-semester honors thesis project (AMST 691H and AMST 692H or FOLK 691H and FOLK 692H) in consultation with an advisor. Students have received summer undergraduate research fellowships, earned research support and travel awards, and presented their work at the Annual Celebration of Undergraduate Research each spring.

Anthropological expertise has special application for hidden histories and the ancient past; the intersection of human biology and ecology; and the way communities create and use meaning, values, and history in everyday life. We support studies, research, and professional applications in these areas with three programs of foundational training: archaeology; human biology, ecology, and evolution; and sociocultural anthropology.  Cutting across these specializations, the department supports concentrations that integrate anthropology’s diverse expertise to address contemporary world problems. Programming in these areas helps students connect their anthropological studies to work and life beyond the University. Current concentrations focus on health, medicine, and humanity; heritage and unwritten histories; global engagement; race, place and power; and food, environment, and sustainability.  Together, the Department of Anthropology’s programs and concentrations offer the undergraduate student one of the best introductions possible to our biological and cultural pasts and to our contemporary world. Anthropology majors thus develop the written and oral skills needed to live and work in a complex world marked by an accelerated rate of environmental, social, and cultural change. Anthropology majors acquire general knowledge and skills valued within a large number of occupations and professions, including but not limited to professional anthropology.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies (see “Contact Information” above) works with current and prospective majors and minors by appointment. Students are encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies about course choices and field work opportunities. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the honors program may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  There are three basic career paths for B.A.-level anthropology majors:  • Anthropology majors have open to them all of the career options  of any student with a bachelor of arts degree in the liberal arts and social sciences, with the added advantage that they surely are more  prepared than most in the growing international arena of business, government, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The resources and professional staff of University Career Services and the department’s director of undergraduate studies can provide guidance.  • Anthropology majors can seek a career that puts their anthropology  degree directly into practice.  • Lastly, anthropology majors can continue with graduate education in order to seek a career in education, either as a social studies teacher in a school or a professor in a university.

ANTH–Anthropology  The basic division in undergraduate anthropology courses is between lower-division courses numbered below 300 and upper-division courses numbered between 300 and 699. Sophomores should not hesitate to take courses numbered 300 to 699 because of fears of their difficulty but may wish to consult the instructor before enrolling. Undergraduate-level Courses ANTH 50.

An honors course fulfills the same  requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment and GPA restrictions may apply.  1  The theoretical perspectives requirement serves as the major’s core course; it offers an integrative perspective on the theories and history of anthropology and explores what it means to be an anthropologist. Majors should fulfill this requirement in their junior year. If they cannot do so, they should consult with the director of undergraduate studies.  The department recommends that majors enroll in some field-oriented coursework such as ANTH 393, ANTH 395, ANTH 451, ANTH 453, or in study abroad coursework.  Special Opportunities in Anthropology Honors in Anthropology Writing an honors thesis is an excellent way to cap one’s major in anthropology. The process offers students the chance to carry out original research on a topic that they are passionate about. Our thesis writers work closely with a faculty advisor and committee members to develop their project. The department provides excellent support, offering a specific seminar during the fall (ANTH 691H) and a corresponding independent study (ANTH 692H), that together walk students through the essential steps of research design and writing. For our students, writing an honors thesis continues to prove a pivotal experience—at once a capstone to their studies at Carolina and an achievement to carry with them into their lives and careers beyond.  To pursue an honors thesis project, students must:  • Maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.3 from the spring  semester of the junior year through the entirety of the senior year  • Secure a faculty advisor who is an anthropologist at UNC-Chapel Hill. • Successfully complete the ANTH 691H and ANTH 692H sequence • Receive approval from UNC’s Office for Human Research Ethics prior  to the start of research, for all projects involving human subjects  The process for approval requires several steps:  • Students considering an honor thesis should first contact the director  of undergraduate studies or the honors thesis seminar instructor, during their junior year (or earlier).  • Eligible students next should secure an advisor prior to enrolling in ANTH 691H for the fall semester of their senior year. Typically, the advisor is a professor that they have worked with in a class or faculty member with shared interests.  • In the fall students develop their research design and begin to write  their thesis (ANTH 691H).  • In the spring, students complete an independent study with their  advisor, focusing on writing the thesis (ANTH 692H). Students also form their committee, by adding two additional faculty members.  • To complete the process, students defend (i.e., present and discuss)  their thesis to their committee.   Internships, Field Work, and Independent Study Students who wish to explore an anthropological concern outside the conventional classroom setting, or who desire advanced or specialized  ANTH 393 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage in internships or other field experiences within or beyond the University that have a significant anthropological learning component. Variable credit may be obtained for this course. ANTH 393 is a controlled enrollment course; it requires the permission in advance of the faculty member sponsoring the internship, of a responsible official of the agency in which the internship is carried, and of the director of undergraduate studies. It is essential that students make arrangements and secure permissions prior to the semester of the internship.  ANTH 396 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage in independent study, and ANTH 395, the opportunity to engage in field research, in both cases under the mentoring of a specific faculty member. Variable credit may be obtained for these courses, although three units are usually expected. ANTH 396 and ANTH 395 require the permission of the faculty member under whom the student wishes to conduct research prior to the semester in which ANTH 396 or ANTH 395 is taken. Both are controlled enrollment courses. In general, these courses should be taken only by students with some prior coursework in anthropology or a related social science.  ANTH 451 and ANTH 453 are six-unit field school courses in which the student gains hands-on experience in research and study in the field under the direction of a faculty member.  Anthropology majors are limited to having no more than six credit hours of field-oriented coursework (ANTH 393, ANTH 395, ANTH 451, or ANTH 453) count toward meeting the major requirement, although they are not restricted from enrolling in more than six credit hours of these courses combined. Study Abroad Anthropology majors are encouraged to enroll in a study abroad program. These programs can offer direct experience of another culture and intensive language training, as well as excellent coursework in anthropology. By consulting with their departmental advisors as well as with the University’s Study Abroad Office, students can assess the relevance of available programs to their interests and arrange to transfer credit hours to count toward their undergraduate degree and, where appropriate, the anthropology major. Study abroad programs are often affordable even to students who require financial aid. Information about student loans and scholarships for the purpose of studying abroad can be obtained from the Study Abroad Office. Undergraduate Awards The Honigmann Undergraduate Honors Thesis Award is given each year to the student who completed the best undergraduate honors project.

Special Opportunities in Archaeology Honors in Archaeology Students with a grade point average of 3.3 or higher are eligible to pursue a degree with honors. A student who wishes to take this track should identify and contact a faculty thesis advisor before the end of the junior year. During the senior year the student enrolls in a two-semester course sequence, ARCH 691H and ARCH 692H, which provides the opportunity to carry out an independent research project and write a thesis under the direction of the faculty advisor. Prior to registering for the honors courses, the student and faculty mentor must fill out a contract and have it signed by the curriculum’s director of undergraduate studies. The thesis is evaluated by a committee consisting of the advisor and two readers. The advisor and at least one reader must be members of the Curriculum in Archaeology’s faculty. A student who successfully completes the thesis may be awarded honors or highest honors by the committee. Highest honors is awarded only in cases where the thesis is judged to be exceptional in comparison to other such works. Research Laboratories of Archaeology Founded in 1939, the Research Laboratories of Archaeology (RLA) was the first center for the study of North Carolina archaeology. Serving the interests of students, scholars, and the general public, it is currently one of the leading institutes for archaeological teaching and research in the South. Located within the College of Arts and Sciences, it provides support and research opportunities for UNC–Chapel Hill students  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            173  working not only in North Carolina but also throughout the Americas and overseas. Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology (CCMA) The Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology represents a collaboration between the institutions in order to enhance archaeology curricula and concentrations in the respective departments and programs in archaeology. The consortium fosters an interdisciplinary dialogue on methods, theory, and practice in classical archaeology and material culture, providing students access to coursework, seminars, excavations, and other research opportunities; academic advising; and avenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction. Experiential Education The development of skills and perspectives beyond the classroom is considered central to the curriculum in archaeology. Hands-on training in field archeology provides students with the basic tools not only necessary for graduate training and advanced research in archaeology, but also for careers in cultural resource and heritage management through government agencies, contract firms, and museums. Developing an understanding of context and physical environment in archaeology requires field and laboratory experiences that are impossible to teach effectively in the classroom. Excavation and laboratory experiences allow students to participate directly in faculty research and to learn firsthand important aspects of the research process. Two or more field schools in archaeology are generally offered during summer sessions through the Study Abroad Office by faculty from the departments of anthropology, classics, religious studies, and history. In addition, many faculty research associates offer laboratory experiences through independent study projects and internships. These field work and laboratory experiences are designed to enhance the classroom training, allowing students to work as assistants to field archaeologists and specialists—such as surveyors, archaeological architects, palaeoethnobotanists, zooarchaeologists, biological anthropologists, and geomorphologists—learning firsthand various aspects of data recovery, processing, and interpretation associated with archaeological field projects.

From a strong central core in the traditional practices of making and interpreting art, the faculty and students at UNC–Chapel Hill move out in innovative and personal directions. We cultivate exchange between studio art and art history and offer maximum flexibility within our individual programs.  The art history curriculum is designed to help students acquire an individual perspective on their own values and beliefs and on their places in a society increasingly shaped by visual communication. Majors and minors in art history become acquainted with the historical significance, cultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions, enabling students to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a variety of social contexts.  The studio art program encourages experimentation, crossing boundaries, and hybrid processes as well as engaging the history and traditions of art. Through directed practice and creative research, faculty work closely with students to stimulate aesthetic and intellectual inquiry, impart portable skills, and motivate self-exploration to help students create outstanding works of art.  Students may choose from a range of studio coursework designed to develop both skills and a personal creative vision. Students develop two critical skills: the means of self-expression and techniques for creative thinking. While the undergraduate program focuses on the fine arts, the course of study nonetheless offers a sound foundation for students to move into art education, design fields, and other art-related careers as well as preparation for further study or careers in the fine arts.  Credit by Examination  Students who pass the Advanced Placement (AP) examination in art history and earn a score of 4 or 5 will receive credit for ARTH 152.  Students who fulfill the studio art portfolio requirements for the Advanced Placement (AP) examination and earn a score of 4 or 5 will receive placement only (PL) for ARTS 102, ARTS 103, or ARTS 104.  Students who score a 3 can petition to waive relevant prerequisites via portfolio review, although no course credit will be given. Students earning a score of 6 or higher on the International Baccalaureate (IB) portfolio will receive placement only (PL) for ARTS 104. Students who score a 5 on the IB may petition for a portfolio review to determine if they can exempt ARTS 102 or ARTS 104. Advanced Placement by Portfolio Review In addition to the threshold scores mentioned above, art majors who have broad experience in visual art may petition to exempt foundation requirements by submitting a portfolio for review. If the review is successful, students do not receive credit for these courses; rather, the credit hours are redistributed to the studio concentration or elective requirement of the major. Portfolio requirements are modeled after the College Board Advanced Placement portfolio guidelines. These guidelines are available from the director of undergraduate studies in studio art, the student services administrator, or on the art majors’ Sakai site. Portfolios are reviewed annually in September. Contact the director of undergraduate studies in studio art at the beginning of the fall semester to make arrangements.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s directors of undergraduate studies and undergraduate advisors work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above). On request, art history majors may be assigned an individual faculty advisor. The studio area also holds general advising sessions prior to registration each semester. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering honors thesis work or graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the honors program may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Additionally, special informational sessions are held periodically to guide students on awards, study abroad, internships, and research opportunities (especially the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships). These sessions are announced on the art majors'' listserv and Sakai site, as well as by posters in the Hanes Art Center and Art Lab.  Facilities  The department possesses outstanding facilities for the teaching of both art history and studio art in the Hanes Art Center. The building houses state-of-the-art facilities for image projection required in art history. Specialized classrooms for art practice include large studios for painting, drawing, and mixed media. A dedicated space is available for installation projects. The John C. Henry Printmaking Studio is a wonderfully spacious 3,325 square foot laboratory providing ambient work space for a variety of printmaking processes. Studios for photography include both wet (black and white) and digital photography and a dedicated shooting studio. The digital laboratories at UNC–Chapel Hill are Mac-based, with the most current software needed for work in photography (including large-scale output), video, and digital/electronic media. Students enrolled in studio art classes have 24-hour access to these laboratories. In addition, the 17,686 square-foot Art Lab, located 1.8 miles north of the Hanes Art Center (108 Airport Drive), houses the department’s sculpture facilities.  Department of Art resources also include the Joseph C. Sloane Art Library with its collection of 100,000 volumes, which is supplemented by the  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            177  3  9  3  9  12  12  Tier III Studio Art Courses: ARTS 302, ARTS 303, ARTS 313, ARTS 352, ARTS 368, ARTS 390, ARTS 391, ARTS 402, ARTS 403, ARTS 410, ARTS 413, ARTS 415, ARTS 416, ARTS 417, ARTS 418, ARTS 428, ARTS 490, ARTS 493, ARTS 499, ARTS 500, ARTS 515, ARTS 596, or ARTS 636 Studio Art Electives: Any Tier I, II, or III courses or first- year seminar or an internship.

The department’s Visual Resources Library contains 250,000 slides, 40,000 photographs, and 20,000 digitized images. The University’s Ackland Art Museum is located adjacent to the Hanes Art Center. The Ackland’s programming regularly augments the educational experience of the University community.  The John and June Allcott Galleries in the Hanes Art Center are sites for numerous exhibitions throughout the year. The main gallery has an exhibition schedule of 12 to 15 shows each year, including the annual award and graduation shows of undergraduate work as well as work by professional artists, faculty members, and graduate students. The John and June Allcott Undergraduate Gallery is the exhibition space designed especially for work produced or chosen by undergraduate students. The Alumni Sculpture Garden occupies the grounds surrounding the Hanes Art Center. Temporary exhibitions of sculpture are commissioned by the department and are on display for a two-year period. Commissions are awarded annually to undergraduate and graduate students.  3  3  0  3  6  B.F.A. 3 9  B.F.A-A.H. Not required 9  Studio Art Credit Summary: B.A., B.F.A., B.F.A.–A.H.

The department oversees a joint graduate and undergraduate program at these institutions. While a complete curriculum is offered on the UNC–Chapel Hill campus, students can elect to take any number of classes at NC State. The joint program also leverages the industry resources in Research Triangle Park, located roughly half way between the two campuses, providing unique opportunities for students.  Biomedical engineering is a profession that develops and applies engineering knowledge and experience to solve problems in biology and medicine and to enhance health care. Biomedical engineers are professionally trained to combine the rigors of medical and biological studies with the power of engineering analysis and design. People become biomedical engineers to be of service to others, to enjoy the excitement of understanding living systems, and to use state-of-the- art science and technology to solve the complex problems of medical care. The emphasis in biomedical engineering is on finding solutions by researching, testing, and applying medical, biological, chemical, electrical, and materials engineering approaches. Biomedical engineers are unique individuals who make contributions to health care that are both satisfying to themselves and beneficial to others.  Facilities  The Department of Biomedical Engineering houses an undergraduate student design laboratory. It contains equipment for rapid prototyping (three-dimensional printer and laser cutter), as well as electronics and microcontroller design and development. Students also use facilities in other departments that have laboratory-based courses. The BeAM Makerspace facilities are available to all UNC students, and these facilities house a variety of mechanical and electronic fabrication tools. More information is available at the UNC BeAM Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Many students from this program have pursued further education in graduate school in biomedical engineering. Our alumni have attended many of the top-ranked biomedical engineering programs. In addition, some students have pursued graduate degrees in other disciplines in engineering, as well as related fields such as microbiology, sports physiology, public health, and business/engineering management, among others. Students have also been accepted into clinical programs such as medical, dental, physical therapy, and pharmacy schools (in many  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            277  cases, the student must take several additional courses to meet the requirements for clinical programs).  For those interested in going directly into a career, biomedical engineering is one of the fastest growing career opportunities. Graduates are employed by hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device and testing companies, government agencies, universities, and medical schools.

This is an official UNC– Chapel Hill club that organizes speakers, outreach to industry and the medical school, and mentoring, among other activities. This is also a joint club with the BME students at North Carolina State University. Experiential Education All students in biomedical engineering participate in a capstone design experience in which they develop a device or system that has biomedical applications. This project fulfills the General Education experiential education requirement. There are also opportunities for experiential education outside of the curriculum. These opportunities include Helping Hands, which develops 3-D printed prosthetic hands, and Engineering World Health, which develops medical equipment for under-resourced populations. Undergraduate Awards Awards are given to students in the graduating class each spring. Undergraduate Research Students are strongly encouraged to undertake a research project at any time during their education, but particularly during their junior and/ or senior years. Through the challenge of a research project, students come face to face with the leading edge of an area, gain expertise with state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation, and experience a professional scientific career firsthand. Many undergraduate students work in the research laboratories of BME faculty members. In addition, faculty across campus conduct BME-related research, and many undergraduate students take advantage of these research opportunities in the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Pharmacy, and in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy, Computer Science, and Exercise and Sport Science.  The BME department helps to coordinate research activities and facilitates connections between students and research laboratories. This is accomplished through communication via e-mail and the department Web site. Also, the department organizes laboratory open houses, enabling students to visit faculty laboratories and learn about their research opportunities. The UNC–Chapel Hill Office for Undergraduate Research is also an excellent resource for finding research opportunities.

KOSOROK, Chair  Introduction  The Department of Biostatistics in the Gillings School of Global Public Health was the first undergraduate program in the country to offer an undergraduate degree in biostatistics. The degree provides an excellent foundation for continued studies (primarily graduate school in biostatistics, epidemiology, or medical school) and a strong foundation for employment in the health care industry for highly qualified students interested in quantitative methods applied to public health and medicine.  Advising  The program director serves as the academic advisor for all biostatistics undergraduates. Undergraduate students are encouraged to meet regularly with the program director and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. In addition, they can also visit the Office of Student Services. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those students who are considering proceeding to graduate school, double majoring, or pursuing the dual B.S.P.H.–M.S. degree. Further information may be obtained in the Academic Information Manual (http:// sph.unc.edu/bios/bios-degrees).  Facilities  The Department of Biostatistics has a student library, a student study room, and computer facilities for its students.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  In recent years, the majority of undergraduate biostatistics students from this program have chosen to attend medical school or graduate school in biostatistics (or other closely related fields) following graduation. More than 65 percent of recent graduates have entered medical school or graduate programs (primarily biostatistics) immediately following graduation. Recent graduates are attending top-ranked medical schools at Johns Hopkins University, Vanderbilt University, University of Virginia, Duke University, and UNC–Chapel Hill. Biostatistics graduate programs where students have matriculated immediately following completion of this undergraduate program include the University of Washington–Seattle, Harvard, UNC–Chapel Hill, and the University of Michigan. Previous graduates who chose to seek employment have taken positions in the pharmaceutical industry, contract research organizations, and medical settings. Examples of employers of recent graduates include Duke Clinical Research Institute, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Rho, PPD, National Institutes of Environmental Health Science, and Research Triangle Institute. Traditionally, career opportunities have been outstanding for skilled biostatisticians.  Major  • Biostatistics Major, B.S.P.H. (p. 286)  Administration  MICHAEL R.

Faculty members’ readiness to guide the students in their honors work governs the final selection of those allowed to enter the program. Students completing an honors program must register for BIOS 693H and BIOS 694H. Experiential Education The required course, BIOS 664, fulfills the General Education experiential education requirement. In addition, students are required to take BIOS 691 during the fall semester of the senior year. This course consists of an orientation to and observation of six or more major nonacademic institutions in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park area that employ biostatisticians, including contract research organizations, nonprofit companies, and government agencies. BIOS 691 does not fulfill the General Education experiential education requirement. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Students are encouraged to investigate part-time employment during the academic year and full-time employment during the summer after their junior year with members of our faculty and their collaborators on current research and service projects. Study Abroad Students are encouraged to participate in the University’s study abroad programs in the summers or before matriculating to the B.S.P.H. in biostatistics program. Identification of a study abroad program early in the student’s career is necessary for course planning purposes. Undergraduate Awards The Theta Chapter of Delta Omega honors up to 10 percent of the department’s graduates with an award of excellence. Awards are  \f288         Biostatistics Major, B.S.P.H.  presented in the spring as part of the biostatistics awards ceremony. Among the recent graduates, a notable proportion of students has been inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. Undergraduate Research Students are encouraged to consider doing senior honors research and should consult individual faculty members for opportunities. However, some students choose to take advantage of the myriad part-time employment opportunities with our faculty members on their research and service projects or opportunities within nearby Research Triangle Park.  \fDepartment of Cell Biology and Physiology Contact Information  Department of Cell Biology and Physiology http://www.med.unc.edu/cellbiophysio 5200 Medical Biomolecular Research Building, CB# 7545 (919) 966-5241  Kathleen Caron, Department Chair kathleen_caron@med.unc.edu  KATHLEEN CARON, Chair  The Department of Cell Biology and Physiology in the UNC School of Medicine was formed in July 2012 through the merger of the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology and the Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology. The department offers courses for premedical, predental, nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, and allied health students, as well as students pursuing science majors.

Departmental Involvement Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and the undergraduate advisory board. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses. Special Topics Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and  Undergraduate Research Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience. The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.  More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.  The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in CHEM 395.  Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396  \ftogether may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395 may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601).

Alexanian, Director of Undergraduate Studies eja@email.unc.edu  Donnyell Batts and Jill Fallin, Chemistry Student Services Coordinators chemus@unc.edu  Chemistry is the scientific study of the composition and properties of matter and the investigation of the laws that govern them. All chemists have a common core of knowledge, learned through a highly structured sequence of undergraduate courses in which the content is divided into the classical subdisciplines. Toward the end of students’ progress through their four years of undergraduate study, they may choose to concentrate in one or more areas of chemistry through the courses selected to fulfill the chemistry elective requirements and through undergraduate research.

Special Opportunities in Chemistry Honors in Chemistry Upon the recommendation of the Department of Chemistry, the B.A. or B.S. degree with a major in chemistry may be awarded with honors in chemistry or highest honors in chemistry.  Highest honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on a truly exceptional student who has excelled in coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable depth and significance. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  \f304         Chemistry Major, B.S.–Biochemistry Track  • B.A. candidates must have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.85 or higher; B.S. candidates, a chemistry major grade point average of 3.75 or higher.  • Have completed at least five courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above. For B.A. candidates one of these may be a laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture courses.  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies  Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following guidelines:  • Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or  higher  • Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry  courses  • Have completed at least three lecture courses in chemistry numbered  CHEM 420 or above  • Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified  to be of honors quality by the research advisor and two faculty members appointed by the vice chair for undergraduate studies  Students who wish to qualify for either of these awards should begin planning their course programs and research activities in the junior year so that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper- level courses and research. Departmental Involvement Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and the undergraduate advisory board. Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses. Special Topics Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of classes. Undergraduate Awards Excellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized by the department through the following awards:  • Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented  to the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in chemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the department, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and president of the American Chemical Society.  • Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is  presented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to pursue a career in medicine.  • Jason D. Altom Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research: This  cash award recognizes research potential of an undergraduate chemistry major.  • J. Thurman Freeze Scholarship: This scholarship serves to fund summer research between a student’s junior and senior years. • E.C. Markham Summer Research Fund: The department chair  selects the recipient of this award, who will use the salary to perform research between the junior and senior years.  • Carrie Largent Award for Research Excellence: This award is given  annually to a graduating senior who has excelled in research.  • David L. Stern Scholar: Top students from upper-division laboratory  courses are chosen for this cash award.  • AXE Sophomore Chemist Award: A cash award and certificate are  presented to an outstanding sophomore chemistry major. • James H. Maguire Memorial Award: This award goes to an  outstanding and academically gifted junior honors student majoring in chemistry.  • Tanya R. Ellison Scholarship: A female, junior or senior B.S. chemistry  major is selected for this cash award on the basis of character and academic commitment.  • Hypercube Scholar Award: An outstanding senior majoring in  chemistry is given this chemical software package.  Undergraduate Research Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience. The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.  More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.  The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in CHEM 395.  Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396 together may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395 may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST  \fstudents also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601).

Planners are involved, for example, in forecasting what futures may hold for a region, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing transportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting the environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban neighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing societal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness, environmental pollution, and urban decay.  City and regional planners work for a variety of public and private organizations. In the public sector local, state, and federal governments all employ city and regional planners. In the private sector, planners work for development companies, consulting firms, and a variety of nonprofit organizations.  For undergraduates the Department of City and Regional Planning offers basic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience, and an academic minor. Undergraduate students take courses in the department for several reasons: to learn about cities and planning processes, to enrich or expand their current area of interest in different aspects of urbanization, or to explore the possibility of graduate work leading to a career in planning. Planning courses allow students to see how the arts and sciences can be applied to improve the prosperity and livability of cities, towns, and rural areas. In this way they help students deepen their appreciation of their major field of study. Some planning courses may fulfill General Education requirements.  Advising  The department’s director of dual-degree and undergraduate programs serves as the primary point of contact for students participating in the minor (see contact information above). Student advising and approval of equivalent courses are handled through the director. Students also have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building.  Facilities  The Department of City and Regional Planning is located in New East Building on Cameron Avenue. An important resource available to the department is the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, located in Hickerson House, where the research and service programs of the department are housed. The department has strong ties to the Institute for the Environment. Other research centers that are of interest are  \f310         Department of City and Regional Planning  PLAN–City and Regional Planning Undergraduate-level Courses PLAN 50. First-Year Seminar: This Land Is Your Land. 3 Credits. An issue encountered in managing urban communities and environmental quality concerns rights to land ownership. Environmental regulations limit people''s rights to use land as they see fit. This seminar explores processes whereby rights to land, water, and environmental resources of the United States have been acquired, reserved, distributed, and regulated. "

Rives, Department Chair jbrives@email.unc.edu  Janet Downie, Director of Undergraduate Studies jdownie@email.unc.edu  This concentration focuses on the material remains of prehistoric and classical antiquity, while also providing a background in civilization, history, and at least one classical language. The program of study is designed to give students a basic knowledge of the art and architecture of the Greeks and Romans and to introduce them to the use of archaeology in the reconstruction of the past, including Egypt and the ancient Near East. Majors in classical archaeology may not elect a minor in the classical language that they use to satisfy their major requirements, although they may elect a minor in the other classical language. Students interested in majoring in classical archaeology should consult the department as early as possible.  Department Programs Majors  • Classics Major, B.A.–Classical Archaeology (p. 322) • Classics Major, B.A.–Classical Civilization (p. 323) • Classics Major, B.A.–Greek, Latin, and Combined Greek and Latin  (p. 324)  Minors  • Classical Humanities Minor (p. 326) • Greek Minor (p. 327) • Latin Minor (p. 327)  Graduate Programs  • M.A. in Classics (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-  departments/classics)  • Ph.D. in Classics (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-  departments/classics)  Requirements   In addition to the program requirements listed below, students must  • attain a final cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 • complete a minimum of 45 academic credit hours earned from UNC-  Chapel Hill courses  • take at least half of their major course requirements (courses and  credit hours) at UNC-Chapel Hill  • earn a minimum of 18 hours of C or better in the major core  requirements (some majors require 21 hours).

Classical Archaeology (CLAR) course descriptions (p. 313).  Special Opportunities in Classics Honors in Classics Classics majors wishing to take part in the departmental honors program during their senior year must have a grade point average of at least 3.3 at the beginning of their senior year and maintain an average no lower than this through their final semester in order to be eligible for honors consideration.  The program consists of two courses, CLAS 691H and CLAS 692H, taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS 691H involves a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area of the student’s interest and is conducted under the supervision of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral examination by the student’s thesis committee. A grade for CLAS 691H is assigned on the basis of the total semester’s work. CLAS 692H entails the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a final oral defense before the candidate’s committee. This body, in turn, reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit, highest honors is made. Additional Opportunities The Department of Classics supports a number of activities, including informal reading groups; the local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national undergraduate classics honorary society; and annual oral performances and prize competitions in reciting and translating Greek and Latin  \ftexts. Several of the prize competitions involve substantial cash awards. Opportunities for undergraduate research include especially the senior honors thesis and participation in archaeological fieldwork as research assistants. The department encourages majors and minors to take part in summer archaeological field projects; there are current field projects directed or codirected by department faculty members and associates at Azoria in Crete and at Huqoq and Omrit in Israel. Other opportunities for study abroad include the programs of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome and the College Year in Athens, and the exchange with King’s College London. A number of departmental fellowships and other funding opportunities can help support participation in archaeological field projects and other research projects. Lastly, the Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology provides archaeology students access to coursework, seminars, excavations and other research opportunities, academic advising, and avenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction across both institutions. For further information about prizes, fellowships, and opportunities for research and study abroad, see the departmental Web site (http://classics.unc.edu/academics/ undergraduate-program-in-classics).

The civilization program is not designed to lead to graduate work in classics, although students do sometimes go on in the field, and it is often taken as part of a double major. Majors in classical civilization may not elect a minor in the classical language that they use to satisfy their major requirements, although they may elect a minor in the other classical language.

Rives, Department Chair jbrives@email.unc.edu  Janet Downie, Director of Undergraduate Studies jdownie@email.unc.edu  Classics Major, B.A.–Greek  The goal of the concentration in Greek is the development of a basic command of the language and a solid knowledge of the literature, history, and culture of the Greeks. Students interested in an undergraduate major in Greek or in a combined major in Greek and Latin should consult the department by the second semester of the sophomore year. For Greek as satisfying the language requirement for the B.A. degree, see the General Education section in this catalog.  Classics Major, B.A.–Latin  The goal of the concentration in Latin is the development of a basic command of the language and a solid knowledge of the literature, history, and culture of the Romans. Students interested in an undergraduate major in Latin or a combined major in Latin and Greek should consult the department by the second semester of the sophomore year. For Latin as satisfying the language requirement for the B.A. degree, see the General Education section in this catalog.  Classics Major, B.A.–Combined Greek and Latin  This is not a double major, but a concentration designed to develop facility in both ancient languages and in the literatures of both Greece and Rome. This program is recommended for students who have a strong interest in continuing classical languages at the graduate level. In this major students emphasize one language yet acquire facility in the other.

Special Opportunities in Classics Honors in Classics Classics majors wishing to take part in the departmental honors program during their senior year must have a grade point average of at least 3.3 at the beginning of their senior year and maintain an average no lower than this through their final semester in order to be eligible for honors consideration.  The program consists of two courses, CLAS 691H and CLAS 692H, taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS 691H involves a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area of the student’s interest and is conducted under the supervision of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral examination by the student’s thesis committee. A grade for CLAS 691H is assigned on the basis of the total semester’s work. CLAS 692H entails the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a final oral defense before the candidate’s committee. This body, in turn, reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit, highest honors is made. Additional Opportunities The Department of Classics supports a number of activities, including informal reading groups; the local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national undergraduate classics honorary society; and annual oral performances and prize competitions in reciting and translating Greek and Latin texts. Several of the prize competitions involve substantial cash awards. Opportunities for undergraduate research include especially the senior honors thesis and participation in archaeological fieldwork as research assistants. The department encourages majors and minors to take part in summer archaeological field projects; there are current field projects directed or codirected by department faculty members and associates at Azoria in Crete and at Huqoq and Omrit in Israel. Other opportunities for study abroad include the programs of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome and the College Year in Athens, and the exchange with King’s College London. A number of departmental fellowships and other funding opportunities can help support participation in archaeological field projects and other research projects. Lastly, the Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology provides archaeology students access to coursework, seminars, excavations and other research opportunities, academic advising, and avenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction across both institutions.

Through its teaching, research, and service, the Department of Communication addresses the many ways communication functions to create, sustain, and transform personal life, social relations, political institutions, economic organizations, and cultural and aesthetic conventions in society; promotes competencies required for various modes of mediated and nonmediated communication; and develops skills for analyzing, interpreting, and critiquing communication problems and questions.  The programs of study offered by the department thus provide a firm foundation for enriched personal living, for professional effectiveness regardless of the specific career one may pursue, and for informed participation in the human community.  Advising  Department advising for the major in communication studies is conducted by  1. a full-time lecturer/advisor who holds office hours in Swain Hall and  Steele Building (see the department’s Web site for the advisor’s office and office hours),  2. the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of  Communication (see the department’s Web site for the director’s office and office hours), and  3. representative faculty members.  Facilities  The department has extensive media production and performance studies facilities located in Swain Hall and Bingham Hall. Swain Hall is home to state-of-the-art media production equipment, classroom space, and editing suites. It also houses Studio 6, where numerous live performances are staged. Bingham Hall contains the Martha Nell Hardy Performance Space.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Upon completion of their degrees, students are prepared for graduate study and research in communication. Advanced study may be pursued in a problem-defined approach to communication research. A substantial number of graduate assistantships allow M.A.-through-Ph.D. and Ph.D.- only candidates to gain experience in research, teaching, production, and administration. Graduate study is characterized by intensive participation in seminars, original research and creative activities, and close work with  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            329  individual faculty members. Students are also prepared for advanced study in related academic disciplines such as law.  The career outlook for students with degrees in communication studies is promising, and graduates enter a variety of professions that value communication knowledge and skills. Communication studies majors are prepared to serve as communication specialists in business; in federal, state, and local governments and agencies; and in public service. Some of the specific areas in which majors pursue careers are teaching, social advocacy, public relations and advertising, personnel management and training, management consulting, video and film production, and work with emerging technologies.  An understanding of communication provides a strong base for a range of career options. The mission of the department is to go beyond narrow technical training by providing a liberal arts approach to communication. This provides the student with maximum latitude for promotion and advancement and avoids limited career opportunities resulting from narrow approaches to the field.  The burgeoning growth of communication industries and support fields provides a range of career opportunities. Graduates of the department, who number well over 4,000, are engaged in a variety of occupations ranging from work for international corporations to jobs at local nonprofit organizations.

Columbia Street, CB# 3175 (919) 590-6000  Diane Pozefsky, Director of Undergraduate Studies pozefsky@cs.unc.edu  Jodie Turnbull, Student Services Manager turnbull@cs.unc.edu  KEVIN JEFFAY, Chair  Introduction  The Department of Computer Science offers instruction and performs research in the essential areas of computer science. Majors receive rigorous training in the foundations of computer science and the relevant mathematics, then have ample opportunity to specialize in advanced courses.  Majors can receive credit for practical training as a computing professional through an internship with a company or organization in the computing or information technology fields. Internships typically are paid positions and involve the student working off campus. All internships for credit must be approved in advance by the director of undergraduate studies. Students interested in pursuing such an internship should contact the director of undergraduate studies prior to the start of the internship.  Majors who excel in the program also have the opportunity to perform undergraduate research in computer science. Research projects may be pursued in conjunction with an existing graduate research group in the department and/or may be used as a vehicle for graduating with honors as described below.  Students with no prior programming experience should consider taking one of the introductory courses, COMP 110 or COMP 116. COMP 101 is intended for students who wish to develop a better understanding of computers in a context that does not involve programming. Students with prior programming experience should begin their studies with COMP 401. COMP 380 and COMP 388 are philosophical and moral reasoning Approaches courses that have no programming prerequisite.  Advising  In addition to general advising through the Academic Advising Program, students can consult designated faculty members within the Department of Computer Science who act as departmental advisors for requirements specific to the major or minor. Beyond course selection, advisors are also available for discussing internships, study abroad in computer science, honors projects, and undergraduate research opportunities. See the department Web site (http://www.cs.unc.edu) for a list of current department advisors.  Majors  • Computer Science Major, B.A. (p. 351) • Computer Science Major, B.S.

Sample Plan of Study  Sample Plans can be used as a guide to identify the courses required to complete the major and other requirements needed for degree completion within the expected 8 semesters. The actual degree plan may differ depending on the course of study selected (second major, minor, etc.). Students should meet with their academic advisor to create a degree plan that is specific and unique to their interests. The Sample Plans represented in this catalog are intended for first-year students entering UNC–Chapel Hill in the fall term. Some courses may not be offered every term.  The following is a suggested plan of study for B.S. majors.  Title  MATH 232  English Composition and Rhetoric  Course First Year ENGL 105 Foreign language level 2 and 3 (Foundations) Introduction to Programming H COMP 110 Foundation of Programming H COMP 401 Calculus of Functions of One Variable I MATH 231 (quantitative reasoning Foundations course) Calculus of Functions of One Variable II (Quantitative intensive Connections course) Additional General Education (p. 23) and elective courses Hours   Sophomore Year COMP 283 COMP 410 COMP 411 MATH 233 PHYS 116  Discrete Structures Data Structures Computer Organization Calculus of Functions of Several Variables H Mechanics H  or PHYS 118  or Introductory Calculus-based Mechanics and Relativity     The second science course (see requirement course list) Three additional Approaches (p. 23) and Connections (p. 23) courses Hours Junior Year Models of Languages and Computation COMP 455 Algorithms and Analysis COMP 550 MATH 547 Linear Algebra for Applications Two courses numbered COMP 426 or greater Three additional Approaches (p. 23) and Connections (p. 23) courses Electives Hours Senior Year STOR 435 Three courses numbered COMP 426 or greater  Introduction to Probability     Hours  3 6 3 4 3  3  8 30  3 3 4 3 4  4 9  30  3 3 3 6 9  6 30  3 9  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            355  Connections (p. 23) and free elective courses (four courses) Electives Hours Total Hours       12 6 30 120  H Honors version available. An honors course fulfills the same  requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment and GPA restrictions may apply.  Notes on the Suggested Plan of Study A first formal course in computer programming (such as COMP 110) is a prerequisite for COMP 401. Students with no programming experience should begin their program of study with COMP 110. Students who are unsure if their background preparation enables them to begin their studies with COMP 401 are encouraged to consult a departmental advisor.  Students who are able to begin with COMP 401 may take it in their first semester and either advance the suggested program of study by one semester (giving themselves an extra free elective in their junior/senior years) or take another appropriate course such as a first-year seminar. In either case, neither COMP 110 nor a first-year seminar is a required course in the major.  This plan of study further assumes that students will place out of foreign language 1. If this is not the case, then the student should start with foreign language 1 (and have one fewer free elective in the senior year).  Special Opportunities in Computer Science Honors in Computer Science Students are eligible for graduation with honors if they complete the following requirements:  • A cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better • A grade point average of 3.3 or better from among the set of COMP,  MATH, PHYS, and STOR courses taken to fulfill the graduation requirements for the major  • Graduation with honors requires the completion of two semesters of research (COMP 691H and COMP 692H). As part of COMP 692H, students must submit a written honors thesis and complete an oral public presentation of the thesis. Graduation with highest honors in computer science is possible for those students whose honors project and thesis are judged by a faculty committee to be particularly distinguished.  Students interested in pursuing honors in computer science are encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies. Experiential Education When arranged in advance with a supervising faculty member, COMP 293 can be used to earn credit for appropriate work experience in the summer. COMP 293 satisfies the experiential education requirement. COMP 495 and COMP 691H can also be used to satisfy the experiential education requirement. Another possibility is through study abroad (see below). Assistantships and Internships In addition to their classroom experiences, undergraduates may enhance their learning experience as research assistants or teaching assistants.  \f356         Computer Science Minor  Students also can participate in nationally recognized research programs or use the department''s facilities to pursue self-directed research with a faculty member.  Work-study students can gain valuable work experience as assistants on the department’s computer services staff. The department also encourages students to pursue internship experiences. Carolina’s proximity to Research Triangle Park means that computer science majors have many internship and postgraduation opportunities available in their own backyard. Study Abroad Study abroad opportunities with priority for computer science students are offered through University College London (UCL) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing.  UCL can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for either a semester or yearlong exchange. For semester-only programs, UCL recommends registering for spring semester rather than fall as it better matches their academic calendar. Many courses satisfying the computer science B.S. requirements can be completed at UCL. UCL is located in the heart of London and is just a few blocks away from UNC–Chapel Hill’s European Study Center in Winston House.  NUS can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for fall or spring semester, or a yearlong exchange. This exchange allows Carolina students to enroll directly into the NUS School of Computing and choose their courses from among the full offering. On a case-by-case basis, students may also be able to take other courses at NUS outside of the School of Computing. Study abroad at NUS is eligible for the Phillips Ambassadors Scholarship. Please see phillips.unc.edu (http://phillips.unc.edu) for more information.  Specific course equivalences for both schools are posted on the department’s Web site. Students interested in taking a course not listed should contact the director of undergraduate studies before registering for courses at the school.  Application for both programs is through the University’s Study Abroad Office. Application to the UCL programs and the NUS fall and yearlong programs takes place early in the spring of each year. Application for the NUS spring program takes place early in the fall of each year. Applicants for exchange participation must have completed at least one year of study at UNC–Chapel Hill and must have declared a computer science or precomputer science major. Study abroad satisfies the experiential education General Education requirement of the undergraduate curriculum. Undergraduate Awards The department awards two yearly prizes to computer science majors. In conjunction with SAS Institute, the department annually presents the Charles H. Dunham Scholarship. The Dunham scholarship includes a cash award to the student and a summer internship at SAS and is awarded in the spring semester to a student in their junior year. The department also annually presents the Stephen F. Weiss Award for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science, which includes a cash prize. The Weiss award is presented to a student in the fall of the senior year.  Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program  Students in the B.S. degree program with a GPA of 3.2 or better after five or more semesters of study have the option of applying to the dual B.S.– M.S. program at UNC–Chapel Hill to pursue graduate coursework leading  to the degree of master of science. Such students must complete the requirements for the bachelor of science degree within eight semesters. Upon completion of the B.S. degree, students then enroll as a graduate student to continue work towards the master of science degree.  The requirements for the master of science degree can be found in the Graduate Catalog. Generally, the master’s degree requires 30 additional hours of computer science coursework. Up to nine credit hours of computer science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be applied to the master’s degree if the coursework is not also used to satisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelor’s degree. The requirements for the master’s can be completed in as few as two additional semesters, for a total of 10 semesters of study.  Students interested in the dual-degree program should have completed (or be on track to complete) seven computer science courses at the 400 level or higher by the end of their sixth semester. Students must formally apply for admission to the combined B.S.–M.S. program, and it is expected that the application process would take place in the student’s sixth semester. Students applying in their sixth semester of study will be notified of the outcome of their application by the end of their sixth semester.  Students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study.

A student may then be designated as a candidate for undergraduate honors or highest honors based on department review of the special project or performance. Departmental Involvement Two undergraduate students are elected each year from among the majors to serve as representatives to the faculty. They attend faculty meetings and host events that bring students and faculty together. Performance/Production Opportunities The Department of Dramatic Art’s Kenan Theatre Company (KTC), offers many opportunities for interested students—majors and nonmajors alike—to participate in performance and production. Each year the department supports four to six full productions in the Elizabeth Price Kenan Theatre. Seasons may include classic plays, contemporary plays, musicals, and original works. A faculty and peer-elected board of five undergraduate students acts as producing director for KTC and oversees the department season. Productions are directed by faculty and guest artists as well as by students. Undergraduate students are involved in the technical components of production as designers, carpenters, painters, electricians, seamstresses, and sound engineers. The KTC producers select an undergraduate prop supervisor, wardrobe supervisor, master electrician, master carpenter, and a technical director for the entire season. Designers are selected on a per show basis and can include undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty members. PlayMakers Repertory Company Several types of student involvement with PlayMakers Repertory Company (PRC, a professional LORT/AEA theatre on campus) are possible. Technical assistance, running crews, internships in administration, and assistant stage management positions are open to undergraduates. Auditions are held during the year for appropriate supporting and understudy roles. PRC engages resident and guest professionals active in regional and commercial theatres as guest actors, directors, and designers. Students have opportunities to associate with and learn from these professionals throughout the year. Study Abroad With more than 300 programs available in 70 countries, there are many international experiences structured to enhance the student’s undergraduate career. Major and minor credit is available as well as General Education credit.

Specific study abroad opportunities for dramatic art students include, but are not limited to, semester or yearlong exchange programs at Trinity  \f366         Dramatic Art Minor  College Dublin, the National University of Ireland in Galway, the University of Glasgow, and Queens University Belfast. Students can also spend the summer or a semester with programs at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) and the Gaiety School of Acting, Dublin.  • take at least 9 credits of their minor course requirements at UNC–  Chapel Hill  • earn a minimum of 12 hours of C or better in the minor (some minors  require more)  Students are also eligible for the Elizabeth Malone Roughton Study Abroad Scholarship, a scholarship awarded to a dramatic art student studying in Ireland for a semester and completing a theatre-related internship as part of the program. Undergraduate Awards Each spring the Department of Dramatic Art awards several monetary prizes to its undergraduate majors (and graduate students) who are continuing into the next academic year. The prizes have been endowed by generous alumni and friends, including Andy Griffith and George Grizzard. In addition, the Sam Selden Prize in Playwriting, the Wes Egan Award in Design, and the Lillian Chason Scholarship are awarded competitively each year. Undergraduate Research Faculty and departmental advisors are available to help students define areas of interest, understand the existing knowledge base in a particular area, and develop a plan for meaningful undergraduate research. These goals can be realized through departmental independent study and honors research. See the director of undergraduate studies and the honors advisor for more information.

CONWAY, Chair  Introduction  Economics is commonly defined as the study of how society allocates scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It focuses upon the fact that we wish to maximize our satisfaction through the consumption of goods and services (including leisure time); however, the resources available for production are limited. Hence, decisions must be made regarding what to produce, how to produce it most efficiently, and how to distribute the output among the various members of the society. Economics analyzes the market framework for making such choices.  At the microeconomic or “individual unit” level, economics examines the behavior of consumers, business firms, workers, and individual markets. At the macroeconomic or “aggregate” level, attention is given to the national and international problems of unemployment, inflation, balance of payments, and economic growth.  The courses leading to a B.A. degree with a major in economics comprise a large area of inquiry into the problems and structure of the economic segment of society. The curriculum provides the opportunity to achieve one or more of the following objectives:  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            369  graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Economics students in recent years have frequently pursued graduate work in law and business administration, as well as the Ph.D. degree in economics. Others have entered international affairs/international studies programs. Students planning to pursue graduate work in economics should continue to take mathematics courses beyond the required level, and a minor or second major in mathematics is recommended.  Most students have accepted employment with commercial and investment banks, accounting and insurance firms, and a variety of other corporations. The economics major competes well with other majors (including business administration) in the job market. Employment surveys of recent graduates by UNC–Chapel Hill’s University Career Services indicate a relatively high ranking for economics majors in terms of employment rates and starting salaries. Note: Recent majors have found that job possibilities are enhanced if at least one accounting course has been completed at the undergraduate level.

Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies and undergraduate advisor work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information” below).

For majors in the department’s honors program, the minimum is eight economics courses rather than seven courses in addition to ECON 101. The same provisions apply, except that ECON 691H and ECON 692H must constitute two of the eight courses.  Note: STOR 113 is recommended for most economics majors. MATH 231 is recommended for students who plan to take the calculus sequence (MATH 231, MATH 232, and MATH 233). MATH 116 is not acceptable.  An economics major may apply as many as 15 economics courses, or 45 hours, toward the B.A. degree. ECON 101 will satisfy the social and behavioral sciences Approaches requirement, and the calculus course will satisfy the quantitative reasoning Foundations requirement. Both ECON 400 and ECON 570 satisfy the quantitative intensive Connections requirement.  Economics (ECON) course decriptions (p. 370).  Economics Major, NUS Joint Degree  UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates can spend between two and four semesters at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and receive a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in economics from both institutions. Qualified UNC–Chapel Hill students will have at least a 3.3 grade point average and can apply for the joint degree beginning in the second semester of their first year until the second semester of their junior year. UNC joint-degree students can decide how many semesters (between two and four) and at which point in their undergraduate career they would like to study at NUS, as long as it is after their first year at Carolina.  A minimum of 120 credit hours is required for graduation. They consist of a total of 60 hours in the major (including as many as six to 12 hours of honors work if applicable) and 45 hours of General Education requirements. The remaining 15 hours consist of electives, the Supplemental General Education requirement, and possibly one minor. All General Education and graduation requirements of both UNC–Chapel Hill and NUS must be met. A detailed listing of the requirements for both schools and how to satisfy those requirements is available at the UNC Study Abroad Office.  Special Opportunities in Economics Honors in Economics The Department of Economics honors program offers outstanding economics students the opportunity to work closely with an individual faculty member on a specialized research topic of the student’s choice during the senior year. Generally, students with a 3.5 grade point average in economics courses and 3.3 in all University coursework may be invited to participate in this two-course program (ECON 691H and ECON 692H).  In the first semester (ECON 691H), students become familiar with the recent literature on topics of major interest. Each candidate formulates an honors thesis proposal and initiates work on the project. In ECON 692H, the thesis work is conducted under the supervision of a faculty advisor who is a specialist in the general topic area of the research.  Near the end of the second semester (ECON 692H), the student stands for an oral examination on the thesis. Upon successful completion of the program, the student receives the bachelor of arts degree with honors or with highest honors. Students in the honors program are also required to complete at least an eight-course major rather than the minimum seven courses, including ECON 691H and ECON 692H. Departmental Involvement Undergraduates in economics have organized an active club, the Carolina Economics Club. Seminars, social activities, and greater interaction among students and with faculty have resulted from the formation of this on-going organization. The Club also has helped the Department of Economics conduct an annual job fair. All majors are invited to participate in this organization’s activities. In addition, the local chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the national economics honor society, annually extends membership to those outstanding junior and senior economics majors who have demonstrated strong academic performance both overall and in their economics courses. Undergraduate Awards Each spring the Chancellor awards the Undergraduate Prize in Economics to the undergraduate student majoring in economics who has been judged the most outstanding on the basis of major and related course performances.

Entrepreneurship is the mechanism by which new products, services, and organizational processes are identified, refined, and ultimately realized as a sustainable part of the society. There is a common process for realizing all types of ventures. The minor will provide the student with the background to undertake entrepreneurial activity in either the business or social realm. The venture workshop course requirement allows students to select an area of focus, including commercial, scientific, social, arts, sport, public health, and social ventures.

Our course offerings present a diversity of approaches to the study, production, and appreciation of literary and nonliterary texts. In our undergraduate program, we pursue a four-fold mission to  evaluate, and promote, in clear and forceful language, new ideas as well as civilizing influences of a shared past or an increasingly global present.

Advising  Because the major in comparative literature is a relatively small major, students and faculty members have the opportunity for frequent discussions. Majors should expect to work closely with the director of undergraduate studies and other faculty members in comparative literature to design and follow a coherent and cohesive plan of study in the major, as well as to consider options for independent research, study abroad, and honors thesis opportunities. Students are expected to review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester and work with advisors in Steele Building to ensure timely progress towards the degree.  All English majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Majors in English and comparative literature provide essential preparation for numerous career paths in business and government as well as in education, the law, and medicine.

Additional Information for Both Comparative Literature Concentrations Students may choose comparative literature as a second major, a particularly attractive option for those majoring in a foreign language because up to four of the foreign language major requirements can also count toward the 10-course major requirement in comparative literature.  Undergraduates majoring in comparative literature may minor in any department, curriculum, or school in which a minor is offered.  Majors should expect to work closely with the undergraduate advisor to design and follow a coherent, cohesive plan of study. Students who study abroad can generally apply their literature credits towards the major. Students completing the global cinema studies track may not complete a minor in global cinema studies.  All majors, regardless of their chosen track, must obtain at least a level 4 proficiency in a foreign language relevant to their individual area of interest. We strongly recommend that students in the global cinema studies track study as many film courses in the original languages as possible.  Sophomores planning to major in comparative literature should take one course under the Great Books I rubric, which treats ancient and premodern literatures, and one course under the Great Books II rubric, which treats literature from 1750 to the present. One of these courses can be used to fulfill the General Education literary arts Approaches requirement.  Special Opportunities in English and Comparative Literature Honors in Comparative Literature Majors with an overall 3.3 grade point average may elect to write an honors thesis by applying for permission to the director of undergraduate studies in the spring semester of their junior year. Students then register for CMPL 691H and CMPL 692H during their senior year. These courses may count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write the 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction of any faculty member. The student conducts independent research during the summer between junior and senior years, often with the assistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year involves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the completion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students finish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an oral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in comparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please visit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site (http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis). Honors in Creative Writing See “Creative Writing Minor (p. 414).\" Honors in English The Department offers at least two English honors seminars each semester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English (a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in major courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during  \ftheir senior year (ENGL 691H and ENGL 692H) and usually produce a 40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally meet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This opportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to be a high point of the student’s academic career. Study Abroad Some of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas are especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of English and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong programs at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain Australian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point average of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the King’s College Exchange Program at King’s College, London (representing either English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also available at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program with the National University of Singapore. Comparative literature students most frequently travel to non-English-speaking destinations.

English Major, B.A. Contact Information Department of English and Comparative Literature http://englishcomplit.unc.edu Greenlaw Hall, CB# 3520 (919) 962-5481  Dr. Eliza Richards, Director of Undergraduate Studies ecr@email.unc.edu  Dr. Hilary Lithgow, Lecturer-Advisor lithgow@email.unc.edu  The major in English equips students to become incisive thinkers and powerful writers. At UNC, English majors develop these skills by learning to analyze a range of literary genres and cultural artifacts: from broadsides and books to digital archives and mp3s; from poetry and the novel to dramatic performance and film. The B.A. with a major in English foregrounds the inventive ways that individuals from various historical and cultural settings have engaged writing and artistic representation to understand—and remake—the world around them.  The core curriculum of the English major offers students a comprehensive overview of the history of English-language literature and thought, from their beginnings in the Middle Ages to the contemporary rise of English as a global language. The core also features introductory courses, which impart analytical, research, and writing skills that help students explore the relevance of literature and other media to questions of history, culture, and everyday life.  The B.A. launches English majors into a digital, global world with historical knowledge about what has shaped it. Because rigorous analysis of literary documents requires sensitivity to the context of their production, students who major in English enter this increasingly technological and transnational world with a crucial skill: the ability to think contextually. In learning to describe and analyze relations between an individual work and its social, cultural, and political environment, our students are equipped for the world outside of the university with the tools for solving a host of intellectual problems—medical, legal, technological, and beyond.

The Creative Writing Program offers a minor in creative writing. The minor requires 15 hours, a total of five courses, and may be earned in one of two ways:  1. by completing introductory, intermediate, advanced, and two-  semester senior honors classes in one genre; or  2. by completing five courses in any combination of genres.  Students need to begin work toward the minor at least by their sophomore year and may take one creative writing class per semester. Enrollment in courses beyond the introductory level is by permission only. Students must seek permission from the program’s director to declare the minor once they have taken two creative writing courses and are on track to graduate. Completion of a minor in creative writing is contingent on the student’s successful advancement through the sequence.  The Creative Writing Program also gives credit toward the minor for several courses offered in other departments, such as DRAM 231, COMM 330, COMM 433, and MEJO 256. To qualify for a degree with honors or highest honors in creative writing, students must maintain a 3.3 grade point average and meet all requirements both to enter and to complete the senior honors seminar (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H). Students minoring in creative writing and planning to study abroad must plan carefully so that they meet all submission and deadline requirements for applying to successive courses. Writing classes offered by the UNC Friday Center for Continuing Education (correspondence, independent study, online) do not count toward the minor. The courses for the fiction track and poetry track are as follows: Fiction: ENGL 130  Introduction to Fiction Writing  3  or ENGL 132H First-Year Honors: Introduction to Fiction Writing  ENGL 206 ENGL 406 ENGL 693H & ENGL 694H  Intermediate Fiction Writing Advanced Fiction Writing Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part I and Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part II (a yearlong, two-semester senior workshop, which counts as two courses and can lead to graduation with honors or with highest honors in creative writing)  Poetry: ENGL 131  Introduction to Poetry Writing  or ENGL 133H First-Year Honors: Introduction to Poetry Writing  ENGL 207 ENGL 407 ENGL 693H & ENGL 694H  Intermediate Poetry Writing Advanced Poetry Writing Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part I and Creative Writing Senior Honors Thesis, Part II (a yearlong, two-semester senior workshop, which counts as two courses and can lead to graduation with honors or with highest honors in creative writing)  3 3 6  3  3 3 6  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            415  Other creative writing courses include: ENGL 138 ENGL 208 ENGL 209 ENGL 210 ENGL 306 ENGL 307 ENGL 309 ENGL 408 ENGL 409  Introduction to Creative Nonfiction Reading and Writing Creative Nonfiction Reading and Writing Children''s Fiction Writing Young Adult Literature Playwriting Studies in Fiction and Poetry: Stylistics Theatrical Writing for the Puppet Stage Collaboration: Composers and Lyricists Lyrics and Lyricists: A Collaborative Exploration of the Processes of Popular-Song Lyric Writing Creative Writing: Special Topics  ENGL 490  3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  3  ENGL 130, ENGL 131, ENGL 132H, ENGL 133H, and ENGL 138, the introductory classes, are prerequisites to other Creative Writing Program classes. ENGL 130, ENGL 131, and ENGL 138 are open for registration by rising sophomores only during spring semester for the following fall and for current sophomores only during fall semester for the following spring. Rising or current sophomores may register for ENGL 130, ENGL 131, or ENGL 138, but not for more than one of these three courses. Demand by sophomores regularly exceeds the number of seats available. Enrollment of juniors and seniors is on a space-available basis by permission of the instructor, and students may inquire of the instructor during the first week of classes to see if seats are available. ENGL 130, ENGL 131, and ENGL 138 are sometimes offered during summer sessions with no registration restrictions. Please always review summer session course listings for any changes or updates.  Advancement to successive courses in either the fiction or poetry sequence is by recommendation of the student’s previous instructor(s) and by application for both the advanced workshops and senior honors seminars. If possible, the student is assigned to a different instructor for each course. Should students not advance beyond the intermediate level, they may choose to finish the minor with other classes offered in creative writing. Creative writing minors receive priority in all creative writing classes and usually fill all seats.  Students completing the five courses for the minor may take additional creative writing courses only by permission of the director, providing that all other students still completing the minor are served first.  Again, please note that online courses do not count towards the creative writing minor. Transfer Students: Important Information The requirement for taking a minor in creative writing is five courses or 15 semester hours. Students are limited to one creative writing course per semester. Most junior transfer students have four semesters remaining. Junior transfer students wanting to minor in creative writing must either  1. Have an introductory course already on their record that will transfer  to Carolina as credit, e.g., an introductory course in fiction writing or poetry writing taken previously at a college or university that is transferring in as credit for ENGL 130 or ENGL 131; OR  2. Take an introductory course via UNC–Chapel Hill Summer School prior to their first fall term at Carolina and be promoted to the next level or to another creative writing class (on a space-available basis) in the fall of their junior year.  Permission to move forward with transfer credit for an introductory course requirement (Option 1 above) will require a review by the creative  \f416         English Minor  writing faculty of the syllabus and work completed in the course and is dependent on space availability, which cannot be guaranteed. Students must provide hard copies of syllabi and samples of coursework as early as possible in order to ensure time for review and to schedule a meeting with the director.  Junior transfer students fulfilling one of these two options would be eligible for Advanced Fiction or Poetry (ENGL 406 or ENGL 407) and the senior honors seminars (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H) if there is space available in Intermediate Fiction (ENGL 206) or Intermediate Poetry (ENGL 207) their first fall semester, and if—on the basis of submitted work reviewed by a committee—they are chosen for those classes. If not, they would need to complete the minor using the multigenre approach.  Note: No more than two creative writing courses from other schools may be counted for credit at UNC–Chapel Hill. At least three of the five courses taken for the minor—courses designated ENGL—must be Creative Writing Program courses taken at Carolina.  Honors in Creating Writing  To qualify for a degree with honors or highest honors in creative writing, students must maintain a 3.3 grade point average and meet all requirements both to enter and to complete the senior honors seminar (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H).

Latina/o Studies Minor Contact Information  Department of English and Comparative Literature http://englishcomplit.unc.edu Greenlaw Hall, CB# 3520 (919) 962-5481  Dr. María DeGuzmán deguzman@email.unc.edu  Dr. Hilary Lithgow, Lecturer-Advisor lithgow@email.unc.edu  Latina/o studies is constituted from the transdisciplinary study of Latina/ o cultural production and experience in terms of a whole variety of factors. Latinas/os are defined as people of Latin American and Iberian descent living and working or based in the United States, but also moving between the United States and the rest of the Americas. Latina/o studies takes as its primary concern the presence of Latin America, Spain, and the myriad combinations of Hispanic-Native-African-Asian and European non-Hispanic cultures within the borders of the United States. However, Latina/o studies is not confined within those borders to the extent that its subjects of study (and the very creators of the field itself) are in motion and in flux, coming and going, crossing borders and boundaries. In this respect it shares some of the transnational and transcultural scope, momentum, and issues of Latin American studies but with its own foci, its own perspectives. Latina/o studies does not duplicate the work of Latin American studies; it draws on it and complements it.  Latina/o studies encompasses Chicana/o studies, Puerto Rican studies, Cuban American studies, Dominican studies, Central American studies, South American studies, and so forth. It takes into account the cultural production and the socioeconomic and political experiences of a diverse population located in many parts of the country, not just in the Southwest borderlands.  The main stipulation of the minor is that students must take a combination of courses in the humanities (literatures and cultural production) and the social sciences (communities and cultural space), some of which have been designated as core courses and others as electives. Students who feel they need a basic introduction to Latina/o studies should take ENGL 364.

It encourages students to explore the cultural and historical dimensions of medical practice by viewing the practice of medicine not simply as an application of chemical and biological analyses of and interventions in the functioning of the human body but also as a cultural practice embedded in changing ideas of disease, health, doctors, patients, medical institutions, and ethics. The minor is available to students accepted into Honors Carolina and to any undergraduate student who has achieved and maintains a grade point average of 3.00 or better.

Cooke, Director of Undergraduate Studies amycooke@unc.edu  Violet Anderson, Student Services Manager vmanders@email.unc.edu  JAYE E. CABLE, Chair  Introduction  The Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology offers diverse and multidisciplinary undergraduate degree programs in environmental science (B.S.) and environmental studies (B.A.). Faculty throughout the University, including the College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of business, government, law, and public health, mentor students through courses, internships, and research opportunities. This unique approach provides students an opportunity to explore the knowledge base needed to understand the environment and its relationship to society, as well as the applications of that knowledge in areas such as environmental modeling; aquatic systems; environmental behavior and decisions; environmental change and human health; ecology, conservation, and biodiversity; and population and the environment. The degrees combine traditional classroom teaching with extensive use of interdisciplinary, team-based projects, internships, study abroad opportunities, and research.  Advising  The Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology maintains an advising system for students with an environmental interest. Students are encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies as early as they wish in their academic plan to discuss options and be assigned to a faculty advisor. Students may use the advising system from the time they enter UNC–Chapel Hill, obtaining advice from specialists in the various environmental fields. This advising system includes opportunities to meet with professionals from government, industry, and consulting to learn about the skills needed to work effectively in those fields if students are interested. In addition we routinely schedule seminars and host visitors who showcase career opportunities by their example in their respective fields.  Facilities  Curriculum faculty members and staff occupy offices and laboratories in Venable/Murray Halls (third floor) and the facilities in Manteo, Morehead City, and Highlands, NC.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  A major in environmental science or studies prepares students for a variety of career options, including marine scientist, ecologist, environmental modeler, environmental policy maker, conservation advocate, land use planner, and environmental educator. Combining either major with other studies at the undergraduate or graduate level  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            421  can lead to careers as an environmental lawyer, epidemiologist, or environmental geneticist, to cite a few examples.

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program  Two dual bachelor’s–master’s programs are offered:  1. Environmental and Science Communication (esc.web.unc.edu (http://  esc.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and Ecology and the School of Media and Journalism; and  2. Environmental Informatics (dualesis.web.unc.edu (http://  dualesis.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and Ecology and the School of Information and Library Sciences.  Each program is designed for students to earn their bachelor’s degree and complete a master’s degree in a professional school in as little as five years. The dual degree in environmental and science communication is approached through the bachelor’s of arts degree with a major in environmental studies, and students then complete a master’s degree in journalism. The dual degree in environmental informatics is approached  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            435  through the bachelor’s of science degree with a major in environmental science, and students then complete a master’s in information sciences.  For the environmental science communication program, students must complete the undergraduate requirements for the B.A. degree in environmental studies and the graduate requirements for the M.A. degree in mass communication as separate degrees. For the environmental informatics program, students must complete the undergraduate requirements for the B.S. degree in environmental sciences and the graduate requirements for the M.S.I.S. degree in information sciences as separate degrees. Students may begin taking courses for the graduate degree while in the undergraduate program, and a limited number of credit hours of approved graduate coursework may be transferred into the graduate degree program in mass communication (up to nine hours) and information sciences (up to 12 hours). Courses taken as an undergraduate for graduate credit may not be counted as part of the undergraduate degree if the intent is to transfer them to the graduate program. Early advising is essential to success in navigating these dual- degree programs. Advisors are available in both units to help students prepare and select courses appropriately to get the most from their education.  Applying for the dual-degree program is a two-step process. It is highly recommend that interested first- and second-year students speak to an advisor early in their college program. Students must submit a conditional application to the program no later than their junior year to ensure that they will receive preference in registering for courses. Students must formally apply to the program through The Graduate School in their senior year. The GRE is not required for applications from current UNC–Chapel Hill students. For complete information on the application process and curriculum requirements, please go to esc.web.unc.edu (http://esc.web.unc.edu).  Special Opportunities in Environmental Science and Studies Honors in Environmental Science or Studies Students in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate in honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest honors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research (ENEC 693H) and culminates in ENEC 694H, thesis writing and defense. Students should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina and meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that appropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on the Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current- students/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)). Honors students can use three credit hours of ENEC 693H (research) or ENEC 694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration requirement. Departmental Involvement The Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an interdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental interests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students and community members with an interest in the environment. The Epsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated to excellence in environmental education. Interested students are nominated for membership. Experiential Education Possibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning courses (ENEC 593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC 259),  \f436         Environmental Science, B.S.  Sierra Nevada Program (ENEC 208), internships (ENEC 393, ENEC 493), research (ENEC 395, ENEC 396, ENEC 698), and honors research (ENEC 693H, ENEC 694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education field sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where students may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall semester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological Station (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine ecology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal policy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the UNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and pollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The Ecuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the following summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge, England (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our advisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange Burch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia, Russia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and physical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and communication). Internships Students are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in local, state, national, and international environmental organizations. Internship opportunities can be found through the environmental internships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu). These internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may be conducted for academic credit. Study Abroad Exchange and other study abroad programs are available through the UNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses for UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take courses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer credit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad during their career at Carolina. Undergraduate Awards Undergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards, Mary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships. Undergraduate Research All students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an independent or team research project. Such projects introduce students to the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important opportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental faculty members and graduate students at UNC–Chapel Hill, as well as in the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The Triangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental organizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities for students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from fundamental scientific research to policy applications.

Special Opportunities in Environmental Science and Studies Honors in Environmental Science or Studies Students in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate in honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest honors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research (ENEC 693H) and culminates in ENEC 694H, thesis writing and defense. Students should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina and meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that appropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on the Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current- students/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)). Honors students can use three credit hours of ENEC 693H (research) or ENEC 694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration requirement. Departmental Involvement The Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an interdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental interests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students and community members with an interest in the environment. The Epsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated to excellence in environmental education. Interested students are nominated for membership. Experiential Education Possibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning courses (ENEC 593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC 259), Sierra Nevada Program (ENEC 208), internships (ENEC 393, ENEC 493), research (ENEC 395, ENEC 396, ENEC 698), and honors research (ENEC 693H, ENEC 694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education field sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where students may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall semester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological Station (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine ecology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal policy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the UNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and pollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The Ecuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the following summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge, England (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our advisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange Burch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia, Russia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and physical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and communication). Internships Students are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in local, state, national, and international environmental organizations. Internship opportunities can be found through the environmental internships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu). These internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may be conducted for academic credit.  Study Abroad Exchange and other study abroad programs are available through the UNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses for UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take courses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer credit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad during their career at Carolina. Undergraduate Awards Undergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards, Mary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships. Undergraduate Research All students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an independent or team research project. Such projects introduce students to the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important opportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental faculty members and graduate students at UNC–Chapel Hill, as well as in the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The Triangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental organizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities for students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from fundamental scientific research to policy applications.

This multidisciplinary approach provides unique academic and research opportunities for students.  Advising  Student advising is overseen by the director of undergraduate studies; individual student advising is distributed among the department’s faculty members. Students interested in one of the concentrations will be advised and mentored by an environmental sciences and engineering faculty member whose expertise is relevant to the concentration. The program director and staff in the Student Services Office will verify that coursework requirements for the concentration have been met. Undergraduate students are encouraged to meet regularly with the program director and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The program director and the Office of Student Services staff work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to the dual bachelor’s– master’s degree. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Facilities  The Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering houses research laboratories located in Rosenau Hall, McGavran-Greenberg Hall, Michael Hooker Research Center, the Baity Building, and off- campus research facilities. These laboratories are involved in important research in water quality, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, effects of environmental chemicals on DNA tissues and organisms, environmental and public health microbiology, and occupational health and safety.  The department also offers facilities for modeling and computational analysis of environmental systems, such as atmospheric circulation and air quality models, ground and surface water flow and transport models, fluid flow and contaminant transport models for indoor air environments, exposure analysis and health effects, risk assessment, and environmental epidemiology.  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            445  More detailed information about the individual laboratories and centers can be found at the department Web site (http://www.sph.unc.edu/envr).  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  While undergraduate education prepares students for citizenship in ways that go beyond professional concerns, the program in environmental health sciences also provides skills needed for employment and graduate study. Students ending their studies at the undergraduate level gain skills necessary to work in positions such as risk analysts in consulting firms and regulatory agencies; research assistants in local, state, and national environmental and environmental health departments; and scientific advisors to environmental organizations. The degree also prepares students for graduate study in the environmental sciences, environmental health sciences, environmental studies, toxicology, and professional disciplines such as medicine, environmental law, and public health.  Undergraduate students with appropriate science backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue a dual bachelor’s–master’s degree. This program allows students to complete a master’s degree in the department within one additional year of study beyond receipt of the bachelor’s degree. Interested students should read the program description and requirements carefully; they can be found online (http://sph.unc.edu/ envr/envr-degrees).  Students have opportunities to explore possibilities for employment through the rich network of connections among the department, University, and numerous environmental organizations in the Research Triangle Park area, which is home to the highest concentration of environmental health sciences groups in the nation.

STEPHENS, Director  Introduction  The Curriculum in Contemporary European Studies is designed to provide students with  1. a broad interdisciplinary understanding of modern Europe and the  European Union;  2. a focused understanding of contemporary Europe from the  perspective of a selected social science discipline; and 3. advanced proficiency in a modern European language.  Students are especially encouraged to combine the major with a second major in a noninterdisciplinary field such as political science, economics, or history. Through its unique combination of advanced coursework and language training, the curriculum provides the intellectual building blocks to study contemporary Europe through a sophisticated framework. Students completing the major will be well prepared for graduate or professional study of contemporary Europe and for a range of international careers.  Advising  In addition to the guidance provided by the primary academic advisors in Steele Building, contemporary European studies majors receive individualized advising at all stages of academic planning, including considering courses, internships, study abroad options, graduate programs, and career paths. Students interested in pursuing a major in contemporary European studies are encouraged to meet with the curriculum advisor as early as possible in their undergraduate career to design a comprehensive and efficient course plan and take full advantage of study abroad and other international education opportunities.

PADUA, Chair  Introduction  Exercise and sport science examines the physics, physiology, and psychology of sport and exercise; the recognition and treatment of athletic injuries; and the administration of athletics. The general major provides foundational courses in exercise science. The athletic training program within the Department of Exercise and Sport Science can prepare students to work as a certified athletic trainer for high school, college, or professional sports teams. Students interested in sport administration can build a foundation in the management of sport. Sport administration career options include almost anything related to amateur, interscholastic, or professional sports. The fitness professional program is designed to prepare students for careers in a variety of health- related fields, including but not limited to entry-level positions in the health-fitness industry; personal training of amateur, professional, and recreational athletes; exercise therapy for a range of clinical conditions; or graduate study in exercise physiology. Other career options for majors include strength-conditioning coach for an athletic team; exercise research within the athletic, medical, or pharmaceutical industries; or fitness club entrepreneur. By choosing additional courses, students can apply to schools of physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health, nursing, or medicine.  The overall mission of the Department of Exercise and Sport Science is to discover and promote knowledge of human movement to improve quality of life.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. In the Department of Exercise and Sport Science five faculty members serve as advisors with weekly office hours (see \"Programs\" above and contact information on the Web site). The department communicates via a listserv, Facebook posts, tweets, blog posts, classroom “advising” visits, bulletin boards/video boards throughout the building, and the departmental Web site (http://exss.unc.edu). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http://exss.unc.edu).  Facilities  In addition to classroom space and physical activity area, Fetzer Hall houses several well-equipped research and teaching laboratories:  1. The Applied Physiology Laboratory is fully equipped to measure  metabolism, body composition, and aerobic fitness. Additionally, it houses a chemistry laboratory to study the biochemistry of exercise.  2. The Cadaver Anatomy Laboratory is designed to teach cadaver  dissection in order to gain a greater knowledge about how the human body works in an athletic environment.  3. The Exercise Science Teaching Laboratory was specifically designed  for teaching exercise science laboratory experiences as well as clinical exercise testing experiences.  4. The Sports Medicine Research Laboratory, equipped with the latest  equipment to investigate athletic injuries related to the biomechanics and kinesiology of movement, offers as its primary research focus the prevention and treatment of athletic-related injuries.  5. The Neuromuscular Control Laboratory is designed for the investigation of neuromuscular and biomechanical factors associated with musculoskeletal/orthopedic injury and disease, including joint stability, muscle mechanics, neuromuscular control, motion analysis, and postural stability.  6. The CPR laboratory is a teaching laboratory for CPR and first aid  skills. The laboratory is equipped with mannequins, AED trainers, and first aid equipment.  7. The Exercise Oncology Laboratory is equipped with the latest  technology for the assessment of cardiorespiratory and pulmonary function, body composition, cognitive function, electrocardiogram monitoring capability, and evaluation of heart rate coherence and heart rate variability in oncology patients.  8. Through its clinical and research initiatives, the Matthew Gfeller  Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center demonstrates its commitment to providing the highest level of care for athletes of all ages suffering from sport-related brain injuries, and to assisting parents, coaches, and medical professionals in managing these athletes.  9. The Athletic Training Teaching Laboratory is designed for students to practice evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation skills. It is equipped with treatment tables, evaluation tools, rehabilitation supplies such as foam rollers, exercises balls, and taping supplies.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Many undergraduate exercise and sport science majors are preparing for graduate work in related areas: exercise physiology, physical therapy, sports medicine, nutrition, athletic training, sports administration/ management, etc. They will be well-prepared for master’s and doctoral programs at major universities. Numerous opportunities exist for graduate assistantships in these areas at UNC–Chapel Hill and other large universities. Numerous career opportunities exist in a variety of fields directly related to sport and exercise. Some graduates go directly into health/fitness/sport-related employment. Others attend professional schools or pursue advanced academic degrees.

EMCH, Chair  Introduction  Geography is the science of space, place, and environment. The department offers classes spanning the social and natural sciences and offering students training in qualitative, quantitative, spatial analysis and modelling, and laboratory methodologies. Human geographers study the spatial aspects of human activity and physical geographers study patterns of climate, land forms, soils and water. Geographic tools and techniques—including Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, and online and interactive mapping technologies—are among the most important for exploring and understanding our complex world. Geographic inquiry is global and local, inherently interdisciplinary, and offers skills that enable insights into pressing issues valued by employers and policy makers. For example, how does climate change impact the way we build cities? How does globalization influence where your jeans are made? How can health disparities between people be overcome through policy change? By synthesizing this knowledge, geographers create unique understandings of our complex world.  Career opportunities for geographers are wide ranging in the public, private, and nongovernmental sectors. Geographers work in the areas of social, health, and environmental policy; energy, transportation, economic, development, and tourism planning; urban and regional planning; research and education; community development; resource management; and environmental regulation and modeling.  With geography you can explore the world and find yourself.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment and during regular office hours (see department Web site as hours will vary by semester). Departmental academic advising is highly recommended for all majors, in particular those considering graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Facilities  The department has a range of specialized, state-of-the-art equipment for geospatial field sampling and laboratory analysis of data in hydrology, climatology, and vegetation science, including an ecohydrology laboratory and a dendrology laboratory. The department is wired internally to support the latest network technology. This network links  us to the centrally managed servers that provide access to a large library of software for geographic applications and research, as well as first-class library resources, data storage and backup, and access to supercomputing clusters.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  There are a variety of job opportunities for geographers in government, business, industry, and the nonprofit sector. Geographers are hired for the following kinds of expertise: locational analysis, GISci, remote sensing, cartography, land use planning, recreation and tourism planning, and foreign area expertise. Many geographers pursue teaching at all levels.  Students with a B.A. major in geography from UNC–Chapel Hill are well trained for graduate programs in geography and other disciplines. Majors have entered graduate programs as diverse as city and regional planning, business, medicine, and ecology. For more information about careers in geography, the UNC–Chapel Hill Department of Geography, degree requirements, and connections to other sites of interest, visit the department''s Web site at geography.unc.edu (http://geography.unc.edu).

Geologists investigate diverse systems that play a large role in controlling the environment at the earth’s surface. Examples include earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciers, landslides, rivers, and shorelines. Earth processes play a critical role in making our planet habitable, and geologists are constantly in demand to guide communities and nations in their search for resources such as clean drinking water and extractable energy and minerals, or in decisions regarding development in fragile coastal regions or in seismically active areas. The Department of Geological Sciences provides students with a solid training in earth science so that they can advance in highly satisfying careers as professional geologists.  Most students planning to do graduate work or to become professional geologists should follow the B.S. program. However, the flexibility of the B.A. program may be advantageous to students with interest in, for example, environmental studies, education, or law.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Facilities  The Department of Geological Sciences houses several laboratory facilities that are available for undergraduate students to use for research. Many students are introduced to the laboratory facilities through coursework. Laboratories include  1. a thermal ionization mass spectrometer for isotope and  geochronology research;  2. a scanning electron microscope laboratory for image analysis,  element mapping, and semi-quantitative chemical analysis; 3. an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for chemical analysis of  geological materials;  4. an X-ray diffractometer for rapid mineral identification;  5. a direct current plasma spectrometer for analysis of major and minor  elements in sample solutions;  6. equipment for geophysical research and imaging, including portable broadband seismic stations, infrasonic microphones, a gravimeter, and equipment for ship-borne reflection seismology;  7. a sediment analysis laboratory including a coulometer, settling tube,  and laser particle size counter;  8. chemical and counting laboratories for quantifying natural and  artificial radioactivity at environmental levels;  9. a paleoclimate/paleoecology laboratory equipped for high-resolution  microsampling of carbonate samples for geochemical analysis.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Geologists commonly are employed by private industry, public and private schools, colleges and universities, and consulting firms (e.g., hydrology, environmental geology, engineering geology, petroleum geology, and mineral exploration). Geology graduates also can find jobs with federal or state geological surveys or with other federal/state environmental or energy firms. Some federal/state agencies prefer geologists with at least a master’s degree. A doctoral degree usually is required for employment at colleges and universities.

Study Abroad Although the department has no formalized study abroad program, many students participate in a study abroad program, and some receive credit for geology coursework completed abroad. Students interested in a study abroad program should contact the director of undergraduate studies. Students must receive approval from the director of undergraduate studies prior to taking courses abroad for geology credit. Undergraduate Awards The Op White Prize in Geology, established in 1966, consists of a cash prize and an engraved bronze plaque displayed in the geology office. The award is given annually to the outstanding senior in geology. Field Camp Scholarships Several scholarships for geology field camp are awarded each year from the Grover Murray and Anadarko funds. Undergraduate Research The Department of Geological Sciences encourages qualified undergraduate students to conduct independent research on an interesting geologic topic under the direction of a geological sciences faculty member. This research can be conducted as a one- to four- credit hour project (GEOL 395) or in conjunction with the geology honors program.

It offers multiple tracks for undergraduate study for those interested in German programs (two concentrations), Slavic programs (two concentrations), and Central European studies (one concentration). A major in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures provides preparatory training that will be useful in government employment; internationally oriented business, journalism, law, and teaching; as well as graduate study in a range of humanistic and social science disciplines.  Advising  Students can complete any concentration, even if they have no prior experience in the language, provided that they begin taking their language courses as first-year students.  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students should meet regularly with their primary advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.  However, departmental academic advising is also important for all students majoring or minoring in the department. Current and prospective majors and minors should confer with the department’s director of undergraduate studies (for German literature and culture, German media, arts, and culture), or the department’s Slavic undergraduate advisor (for Russian language and culture and Slavic languages and cultures), or the department’s Central European advisor (for the Central European studies concentration). The director of undergraduate studies, the Slavic undergraduate advisor, or the Central European undergraduate advisor may all approve study abroad, internship, and transfer credit, and/or serve as an honors advisor, as appropriate for the concentrations they work with.  Students seeking certification to teach German or Russian in public schools should consult advisors in the School of Education.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  In an age of rapid internationalization and globalization, proficiency in a foreign language is no longer just an auxiliary skill but a necessary one. Courses offered in the department make up an important part of a liberal education, and a major can provide excellent preparation for many careers, particularly when the major is combined with courses in business, economics, political science, journalism, and various other  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            511  fields. Recent graduates have entered careers in international business, journalism, publishing, and the travel industry.  A bachelor of arts with a major in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures also qualifies graduates for positions in the United States State Department and other government agencies, educational organizations, foundations, and travel organizations. The presence of over 100 German and Swiss firms in the Carolinas testifies to the demand for a high degree of German linguistic and cultural literacy in college graduates. The department is also one among very few in the United States that offers a range of critical and/or less commonly taught languages of Eastern Europe and the former USSR. People who know these languages are in particularly high demand in business and government. A graduate who has successfully taken the internationally- recognized business German examination “Wirtschaftsdeutsch als Fremdsprache” at UNC–Chapel Hill has an edge in seeking such positions.  In addition, the demand for language teachers provides career opportunities for those German and Russian majors who receive teaching certification from the School of Education.  German and Slavic majors often go on to graduate programs in comparative literature, linguistics, history, law, international business and management, international relations, professional translation, medicine, and education. Some pursue careers as college professors. Many Chapel Hill German and Slavic majors have been welcomed by the most prestigious graduate programs in the country. The department’s faculty members can assist undergraduate majors in selecting appropriate graduate programs.

Undertaking an honors project gives students the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer with the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis advisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during their senior year in GSLL 691H (honors reading and special studies) followed by GSLL 692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL 693H is offered, the course replaces GSLL 692H and provides an opportunity for students majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in the context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these honors courses may count toward the major. Student Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond the Classroom Numerous social and educational events hosted by the department, as well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an atmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic culture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other languages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and advanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures,  \f532         Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Major, B.A.–German Media, Arts, and Culture Concentration  roundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages. Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special events and opportunities.  The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in Germany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic readings in German performed by undergraduate students. Study Abroad The department encourages students to study and/or engage in internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.  The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration; at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent); however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the FUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg. These programs generally include intensive language instruction in addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester, which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.  The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these opportunities.  Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.  Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester- long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For more information about these and other programs in eastern and central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they plan to take for the major or minor.  Languages across the Curriculum The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit (in addition to the credit granted for the course). Undergraduate Awards Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high grade point averages in the major.  The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends, and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in 1987.  Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures. Undergraduate Research In addition to honors thesis work, students are encouraged to work on course-complementary or independent research projects with department faculty.

Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special events and opportunities.  The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in Germany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic readings in German performed by undergraduate students. Study Abroad The department encourages students to study and/or engage in internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.  Only one of the following courses may count toward the major:  RUSS 691H RUSS 692H GSLL 691H GSLL 692H GSLL 693H  Honors Reading Course Honors Reading Course Honors Course Honors Course Honors Seminar  3 3 3 3 3  The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration; at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent); however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the  \fFUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg. These programs generally include intensive language instruction in addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester, which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.  The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these opportunities.  Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.  Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester- long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For more information about these and other programs in eastern and central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they plan to take for the major or minor. Languages across the Curriculum The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit (in addition to the credit granted for the course). Undergraduate Awards Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high grade point averages in the major.  The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends, and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in 1987.  Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures.

The Curriculum in Global Studies offers an interdisciplinary program of study focusing on these and many other issues. It draws on courses throughout the social sciences, humanities, and professional schools and offers students the chance to concentrate on an area of the world and a theme of global significance.  Students prepare for careers in business, diplomacy, international aid, economic development, and other forms of public service. The global studies major is also excellent preparation for graduate school in one of the social sciences, in professions such as law, business, and journalism, or in international affairs and area studies. About 450 juniors and seniors major in global studies.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above) to discuss major requirements, how study abroad credits transfer into the major, and other issues of relevance to global studies. Further information on courses, the honors program, internships, and more are available on the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Global studies majors are prepared for careers in business, diplomacy, international aid and economic development, and other forms of public service. The major is also excellent preparation for graduate school in one of the social sciences; in professions such as law, business, or journalism; or in international affairs and area studies.

Additional Information The curriculum urges that in addition to fulfilling requirements, students continue the study of a foreign language to a level as close as possible to fluency. All majors should also make every effort to include a study abroad program in their undergraduate education, preferably in their sophomore or junior year.  Students must complete all General Education requirements. No courses fulfilling major requirements may be taken Pass/Fail.  Special Opportunities in Global Studies Honors in Global Studies Honors study involves the completion of a substantial piece of original research and the formal presentation of the results in an honors thesis and oral defense. Those who successfully complete the program are awarded their B.A. degree with either honors or highest honors in global studies. Students who wish to submit a thesis for honors in global studies must have at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under normal circumstances, a 3.5 grade point average in the major and must enroll in GLBL 691H and GLBL 692H. GLBL 692H may count toward the major as a theme or area studies course with departmental approval. GLBL 691H will count as elective credit only. Each prospective honors student must submit a two- to three-page prospectus outlining his/her project in the fall of the junior year. Students accepted into the global studies honors program will enroll in GLBL 691H in the spring of the junior year and GLBL 692H in the fall of the senior year. Study Abroad (recommended, but optional) Global studies majors are strongly urged to gain experiential knowledge of the countries and thematic concerns they are studying through participation in an approved study abroad program appropriate to their areas of concentration. Every effort will be made by the curriculum to  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            551  integrate study abroad courses into the major. Students must receive course approval from the director of undergraduate studies prior to departure for a program abroad. No credit will be given unless programs are preapproved. Undergraduate Awards All majors in the Curriculum in Global Studies who study abroad are considered for two study abroad awards that are presented each year. These funds may be used to defray any expenses associated with studying abroad.  The Michael L. and Matthew L. Boyatt Award Fund provides several meritorious awards each year of no more than $2,500 each. They are designated for majors who want to participate in a study abroad program pertinent to their area of concentration within global studies.  The Laura Hudson Richards Fund provides one award of $2,500 each year to a major in the Curriculum in Global Studies who demonstrates both academic excellence and financial need.  In addition, each spring the curriculum awards the Douglas Eyre Prize to the student writing the best honors thesis. The curriculum also selects an annual recipient of the Anne Scaff Award for service to the curriculum and for internationalizing the College. Students chosen to receive the Eyre Prize and Scaff Award are recognized at the curriculum’s spring commencement ceremony.  \f552         Department of Health Policy and Management  Department of Health Policy and Management Contact Information  Department of Health Policy and Management www.sph.unc.edu/hpm (http://www.sph.unc.edu/hpm) Rosenau Hall, CB# 7411 (919) 966-4609  Karl Umble, Program Director umble@email.unc.edu  Jackie Siler, Student Services/Assistant Registrar, Department of Health Policy and Management jsiler@email.unc.edu  SHOOU-YIH DANIEL LEE, Chair  Introduction  The mission of the BSPH program in health policy and management is to develop responsible graduates who have the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to pursue successful careers in health systems in the United States and abroad.

History Major, NUS Joint Degree  History majors may wish to consider applying for the Joint Degree Program, an innovative undergraduate degree program joining UNC– Chapel Hill and the National University of Singapore, one of the top universities in Asia and the world. UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates spend from two to four semesters at the National University of Singapore and receive a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in history from both institutions. For further information about the Joint Degree Program, see the department Web site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate- program/joint-degree-program-with-the-national-university-of-singapore) or contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of History.  Special Opportunities in History Honors in History The departmental honors program is open to any qualified history major with at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under normal circumstances, a 3.4 in history courses, and experience in  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            585  research and writing derived from an undergraduate seminar in history (HIST 398). The student pursuing a degree in history with honors must take HIST 691H and HIST 692H; these two courses contribute credit hours toward fulfilling field-of-concentration requirements, depending on the topic of the thesis. The student, in consultation with the honors director, will choose a topic and locate an appropriate faculty member to supervise a senior honors thesis. In HIST 691H the mechanics of researching and writing a senior essay will be discussed and a start made on the essay itself. In HIST 692H the essay will be completed and the student examined by the supervisor and at least one additional faculty member to be agreed upon by the student and supervisor. To receive highest honors the essay must be recommended by the examiners and a review committee. The director of honors, in consultation with the examiners and review committee, will recommend that the student who has defended the essay graduate with either honors or highest honors, or merely with course credit. Students should submit applications for the honors program by the end of February during their junior year. For detailed guidelines click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate- program/senior-honors-thesis) or contact the director of honors in the Department of History. Departmental Involvement Students with broad interests in the intellectual and social life of the department may volunteer to serve on the department’s Undergraduate Studies Committee (UGSC). Each spring the department invites majors to volunteer for the UGSC, and the selection is made at the start of the next fall semester by the faculty members on the UGSC. Students may also plan or participate in activities organized by the Undergraduate History Club as well as, for those who are eligible, UNC–Chapel Hill’s chapter of Phi Alpha Theta (described more fully below under “Undergraduate Awards”). For more information about the UGSC, the History Club, and Phi Alpha Theta, see department’s Web site or contact the coordinator for undergraduate studies in the Department of History. Experiential Education In some cases, students majoring in history may wish to pursue internship opportunities. Questions and requests regarding internships should be directed to the department’s lecturer/advisor, who has responsibility for evaluating internship proposals and deciding whether an internship may be taken for academic credit. For more information, click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/internship- opportunities-for-history-majors).  All history majors will receive credit for the experiential education (EE) General Education requirement when they complete HIST 398. Study Abroad The department strongly encourages its students to explore the many study abroad opportunities provided by the Study Abroad Office. The experience of studying abroad opens intellectual horizons that can be glimpsed only in unfamiliar worlds, and it deepens one’s appreciation for the enduring power of historical context and circumstance.  The Department of History participates in a unique joint degree program with the National University of Singapore. The department also has an exchange program with King’s College in London. For further information about both programs, contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of undergraduate studies in the department. General information for history majors wishing to study abroad can be found on the department''s Web site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/study-abroad).  \f586         History Minor  Undergraduate Awards All majors who complete the required undergraduate seminar (HIST 398) are automatically eligible for the annual Joshua Meador Prize, awarded to the author of the best seminar paper written in the preceding calendar year. A named prize is also awarded to the author of the best honors thesis; the award is announced at the annual spring honors banquet.  The Department of History sponsors a chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the national history honor society. Students who have taken 12 hours of history courses at UNC–Chapel Hill and who have an overall grade point average of 3.0 and an average in history courses of 3.1 are eligible to apply for membership. An announcement regarding applications for Phi Alpha Theta will be distributed to all history majors in the fall semester. Undergraduate Research The Department of History encourages undergraduate research in a variety of ways. The required seminar for majors (HIST 398) introduces students to historical research. The senior honors program (HIST 691H and HIST 692H) gives students an opportunity to carry out a yearlong research project. In both the fall and spring semesters, senior honors students may apply for competitive awards, including the Michael L. and Matthew L. Boyatt Awards in History for Undergraduate Research and the David Anthony Kusa Undergraduate Research Award, to help support travel for the purpose of research.

In the past, students have designed their own majors in such varied fields as medieval studies, food studies, arts management, medical geography, healthcare policy, medical humanities, cultural studies, behavioral finance, urban studies, documentary studies, computational physics, and enthnobotany.  Advising  Appointments may be made with James Thompson. Inquiries may be made through e-mail (uthomp@email.unc.edu). Students should come prepared with a draft of their major proposal. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Since IDST can provide a broad background in the liberal arts, graduate study in a number of academic disciplines is possible. Students are encouraged to contact the graduate or professional school to which they wish to gain admission to determine the specific undergraduate academic requirements necessary for admission. An IDST major is generally not recommended for students planning graduate study in the sciences, but many students combine majors aimed at medical, legal, or business careers with an IDST major.  Career opportunities for IDST majors are as varied as the reasons students give for selecting the major.

An honors course fulfills the same  requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment and GPA restrictions may apply.  Special Opportunities in Latin American Studies Honors in Latin American Studies Latin American studies majors with an overall grade point average of 3.3 are invited to pursue a degree with honors by writing an honors thesis during the senior year. Each honors thesis is written under the direction of an appropriate faculty advisor; when completed, the thesis must be defended orally before an examining board of faculty members. Honors candidates enroll in the two honors courses (LTAM 691H and LTAM 692H). LTAM 691H counts as a course in the student’s concentration. Experiential Education Students who are particularly committed to field experience or experiential education in Latin America may be able to arrange for this through independent study credit. Students wishing to do so should have the academic support of a regular faculty member and contact the institute’s associate director well in advance of the semester in which the experience is to take place. Intensive Yucatec Maya Each summer the Consortium in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at the University of North Carolina and Duke University offers intensive instruction in modern Yucatec Maya, with a secondary focus on ancient, colonial, and modern Maya culture. The courses include classroom instruction in Chapel Hill (LTAM 411) or in Mérida, Mexico (LTAM 512 and LTAM 690), and a field study experience in Yucatán, Mexico. See the  \f596         Latin American Studies Major, B.A.  Maya program (http://isa.unc.edu/language-programs/yucatec-maya- institute) Web site for current course information. Independent Study Any student may enroll in independent study (LTAM 396) with the permission of the curriculum faculty advisor and the agreement of a Latin American or Caribbean studies faculty member who will supervise the student’s independent study project. This course may be used to fulfill the requirements of the major, and it is often linked to internships or to undergraduate grants for summer research travel. Study Abroad Study abroad is not a requirement of the major; however, living and studying in Latin America or the Caribbean is highly recommended as an experience that majors should consider. The UNC–Chapel Hill Study Abroad Office offers a broad range of programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Visit the Study Abroad Office Web site at studyabroad.unc.edu (http://studyabroad.unc.edu). ISA and the Study Abroad Office offer competitive scholarships for majors wishing to undertake study in Latin America and the Caribbean. Undergraduate Awards Each year UNC–Chapel Hill offers funding opportunities for students conducting research or studying abroad in Latin America or the Caribbean. These include the Julia Crane, Halpern, and Mellon Awards. The Federico Gil award recognizes the best undergraduate honors thesis written on a Latin American or Caribbean topic. Contact the director of undergraduate studies for information. Undergraduate Research Latin American Studies majors are eligible to develop a senior thesis project in their last year. The thesis may be related to a field work project the summer after the junior year. A small number of grants might be available for undergraduate field research in Latin America, especially in connection with a senior thesis.  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            597  or editing and publishing; some careers in these areas may require a graduate degree.

Although it emphasizes graduate training, the department offers basic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience, and an academic minor to all advanced undergraduates. The minor is designed to allow students access to departmental courses, facilities, and advisors in order to develop marine specializations related to their majors and to prepare for postgraduate study in marine sciences or a related field. Introductory courses also are offered for all undergraduates who are interested in marine sciences.  Advising  The director of undergraduate studies advises students on selecting appropriate coursework in marine sciences, reviews progress toward completion of the minor, and assists in approving equivalent courses. All current and prospective minors are strongly encouraged to meet with the director of undergraduate studies prior to declaring their minor.  Facilities  Research laboratories are equipped for general studies in marine sciences and the special research interests of faculty and students. The Institute of Marine Sciences, located in Morehead City, NC, houses laboratory buildings with dock and ocean access. The Institute operates a modern 48-foot coastal vessel, the R.V. Capricorn, and a fleet of outboard-powered boats.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  The director of undergraduate studies advises students on graduate school and/or career opportunities in marine sciences.

Students work directly with faculty members and may enroll for credit as part of an honors or research project. The liaison for undergraduate research provides information about research opportunities in marine sciences, and assists undergraduates in finding a faculty advisor/research group that matches their interests. Experiential Education There are three opportunities for experiential education in the Department of Marine Sciences:  MASC 220 is taught during Maymester at the main campus with one week at the UNC–Chapel Hill Institute of Marine Sciences in Morehead City, NC.  MASC 395 can be taken with the permission of a faculty advisor.  MASC 472 is taught at the UNC–Chapel Hill Institute of Marine Sciences in Morehead City, NC, during the summer session and provides an experience in the field.  \f612         Department of Mathematics  Department of Mathematics Contact Information  Department of Mathematics http://www.math.unc.edu Phillips Hall, CB# 3250 (919) 962-1294  Jeremy Marzuola, Director of Undergraduate Studies marzuola@email.unc.edu  Elizabeth Davidson, Manager of Student Services elizabeth_davidson@unc.edu  RICHARD MCLAUGHLIN, Chair  Introduction  Mathematics has always been a fundamental component of human thought and culture, and the growth of technology in recent times has further increased its importance. UNC–Chapel Hill offers several degrees in mathematics and the mathematical sciences, providing students a choice of careers in this field. Among the jobs in industry, government, and the academic world that involve mathematics are actuary, analyst, modeler, optimizer, statistician, and computer analyst.  Students intending to teach mathematics in elementary and middle school and students enrolled in the School of Education who intend to major in mathematics should consult the School of Education section of the Catalog or the director of mathematical education in the Department of Mathematics. A section below suggests course selections for future high school teachers.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students should regularly meet with their advisors and review their Tar Heel Trackers to be sure that they are satisfying distribution and degree requirements. In addition, junior and senior majors are assigned each semester a mathematics faculty member as an advisor with whom they must meet to discuss course selections and any other questions before a hold on registration is lifted. The department’s director of undergraduate studies and assistant (see contact information above) are also available by appointment. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http://www.math.unc.edu).  Placement into Mathematics Courses  Standardized test scores such as the Advanced Placement (AP), Scholastic Achievement Test Subject Levels I or II (SAT), or the American College Test (ACT) can be used for placement into mathematics courses. Please visit the placement page (http://math.unc.edu/for-undergrads/ placement-info) of the department’s Web site for specific information regarding placement.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  The B.S. degree program, especially if it includes the sequences MATH 521–MATH 522 and MATH 577–MATH 578, is excellent preparation for graduate study in the mathematical sciences. The B.A. degree can be excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields, including admission into professional schools of law, business, and  medicine. Both degrees are viewed by many employers as attractive, especially when accompanied by electives in areas such as statistics, computer science, economics, and operations research. Undergraduate mathematics majors with critical thinking skills and good analytical abilities are in demand in many business, industry, and government fields.

An honors course fulfills the same  requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment and GPA restrictions may apply.  Special Opportunities in Mathematics  Special activities for qualified students include an undergraduate Mathematics Club, problem-solving seminars, the Putnam Mathematical Competition, and the Virginia Tech Mathematics Contest. Students interested in these activities should consult the departmental honors advisor.  Qualified undergraduate students may work as research assistants in the Fluid Laboratory or as tutors in the Math Help Center. Students can conduct original research with the guidance of a faculty member, usually in conjunction with the preparation of an honors project. Study Abroad opportunities include semester or yearlong programs in a variety of countries. The Archibald Henderson Medal and the Alfred Brauer Prize recognize outstanding performance and promise in mathematics.  Undergraduate honors research projects as well as some internships or study abroad programs might qualify for experiential education credit. MATH 290, MATH 396, and MATH 410 satisfy this requirement. Honors in Mathematics Special honors (H) sections are given in some mathematics courses when student demand is sufficient (for example, MATH 62H, MATH 233H, MATH 383H).  Promising students are encouraged to work toward a bachelor’s degree with honors in mathematics. This program consists of six or more courses approved by the departmental honors advisor and satisfactory completion of an honors project completed over the two semesters of the senior year. The honors project is conducted in association with a departmental faculty member on a topic approved by the departmental honors advisor, and spans two semesters of independent research, during which time the honors candidate must be enrolled in MATH 691H and MATH 692H. The final report on the project includes both a written description and an oral presentation before a committee of three faculty (including the project advisor) approved by the departmental honors advisor. The committee will then report to the departmental honors advisor, who, in conjunction with a subcommittee of the undergraduate committee, will make the final recommendation on awarding a degree with honors or highest honors.

GOLDMAN, Chair  The Department of Microbiology and Immunology is one of the basic science departments of the UNC School of Medicine. Although the department participates actively in the undergraduate curriculum in biology and several of its courses are open to undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences, the department does not offer an undergraduate major in microbiology. MCRO 251 is an undergraduate course specifically designed to serve as the required prerequisite for students applying to pharmacy or nursing programs, although other students with the required science background may take the course. Most of the other courses offered by the department are available to highly motivated undergraduate students with the necessary preparation, although it is important for such students to consult the course instructor before registering.  Graduate Programs  • M.S. in Microbiology and Immunology (http://catalog.unc.edu/  graduate/schools-departments/microbiology-immunology)  • Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunology (http://catalog.unc.edu/  graduate/schools-departments/microbiology-immunology)  MCRO–Microbiology Undergraduate-level Courses MCRO 50.

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program  The Department of Nutrition offers a B.S.P.H.–M.S. dual degree for students who wish to increase their knowledge in nutrition and acquire additional skills in nutrition-based research. This dual degree will be useful for students interested in becoming researchers in industry, program officers for nongovernmental and governmental organizations, project or laboratory managers in academic or nonacademic settings, international workers in nutrition-related programs, and graduate  \fFrank Porter Graham Honor Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and the Joseph Edozien Outstanding Undergraduate Award in Nutrition. Undergraduate Research To enhance students’ general education and help them decide whether a research career is something they might pursue, all B.S.P.H. nutrition students are required to complete nutrition research, either as part of the honors thesis or as independent research.  654         Nutrition Major, B.S.P.H.  students pursuing a doctoral degree or eventually attending medical or another professional school. B.S.P.H.–M.S students will perform advanced research in nutrition and take graduate nutrition and other courses that will provide the information and experience needed to help them choose their career path. Additionally, for those students who are uncertain about whether they wish to enter the department’s doctoral program, the B.S.P.H.–M.S program offers an excellent opportunity to determine whether a more advanced degree would be appropriate. The B.S.P.H.–M.S degree is not specific to any of the department divisions; rather, it builds on the work (both classroom-based and research) begun in the B.S.P.H. program. In summary, the B.S.P.H.–M.S program in nutrition allows students the opportunity to explore nutritional research at an advanced level. The program can be completed in one calendar year (summer, fall, spring) following completion of the B.S.P.H. in nutrition program.  Nutrition B.S.P.H. students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult their research advisor and the director of undergraduate studies in nutrition during their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study. For more information see the B.S.P.H.–M.S Dual Degree Nutrition Handbook (http://www.sph.unc.edu/ nutr/degrees).  Special Opportunities in Nutrition Honors in Nutrition The Department of Nutrition provides an opportunity for honors study for qualified students. To be eligible for admission to the honors program students must have, at a minimum, a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 at the beginning of their senior year and must maintain the grade point average throughout the major if they intend to pursue honors. Students register for NUTR 295 (three credits) every semester and then enroll in NUTR 692H (three credits) in their final semester while completing an honors thesis in nutrition. Departmental Involvement The Nutrition Coalition (http://studentlife.unc.edu/organization/ nutritioncoalition) is an organization of students enrolled in one of the department’s five degree programs. The coalition meets several times each semester to address student concerns and to plan service and social activities. Open to the entire University, the coalition strives to broaden the scope of understanding of the various fields and environments in which nutrition is making advances. “A is for Apple” is a student-led, volunteer organization aimed at teaching basic nutrition principles to local elementary school students. Career development workshops are available each year to provide guidance for students applying to graduate and medical schools. Experiential Education Two courses in nutrition include experiential components (NUTR 245 and NUTR 295). However, NUTR 295, available only to nutrition majors, fulfills the General Education experiential education requirement. Undergraduate Awards Nutrition honors research students may apply for the honors undergraduate research awards. The application is available on the Honors Carolina (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu) Web site. Students also may be considered for any of the following awards: Chancellor’s Awards for Excellence in Student Activities and Leadership, The Order of the Golden Fleece, The Order of the Grail-Valkyries, The Order of the Old Well,  \fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            655  PATH 462.

CHARLES JENNETTE, Brinkhous Distinguished Professor and Chair  Introduction  Pathology is the study of disease, its causes, development, and consequences. It is concerned with basic mechanisms of disease processes (pathobiology) and their structural/functional manifestations. Pathology combines the tools and the basic knowledge from many disciplines, such as molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, anatomy, and clinical sciences, to clarify the cause (etiology), natural course (pathogenesis), and diagnosis of disease. The department offers several pathology courses appropriate for undergraduate study.  In addition to formal courses, faculty members in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine of the UNC School of Medicine maintain active research programs and engage in training predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in a range of research endeavors. Undergraduate students interested in participating in a hands-on research experience should contact the director of graduate studies in pathology for more information. Contact information is available on the department’s Web site.

The curriculum brings together faculty and courses from many disciplines to provide undergraduates with a range of approaches to the fundamental issues of human conflict and national and global security and defense. The curriculum prepares majors for graduate work in several of the humanities and social sciences, for a variety of professional schools, and for a range of employment. Graduates have found employment with federal agencies, state and local governments, banks, and other businesses. Others have attended graduate and professional schools in government, history, international relations, and law. The strength of the curriculum is its broad interdisciplinary perspective combined with its depth of focus on topics that span the range of human experience across time and national boundaries, from science and technology to ethics and public policy. In addition to coursework, the curriculum sponsors guest speakers and field trips, and provides majors with help and advice on internships and career planning.  Advising  All majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.

Departmental Involvement Undergraduates can participate in the activities and programs of the Triangle Institute for Security Studies at no cost by becoming a Wickersham Scholar. To become a scholar, a student must have a faculty sponsor and a demonstrated interest in international security studies. For more information contact Carolyn Pumphrey at (919) 613-9280 or pumphrey@duke.edu. Experiential Education Internship courses provide students with the opportunity to earn academic credit while obtaining practical work experience in agencies and organizations clearly related to national and international security. In recent years students have served in these and other agencies: The Central Intelligence Agency, Durham Police Department, Office of Naval Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Carolina for Kibera, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Peace Action, United States Army Special Operations Command, and many more. Students are limited to one internship for credit, and all internships are limited to three hours of academic credit. Although some routine administrative tasks are required in any professional setting, the expectation is that a majority of the intern’s work will be directed toward the substantive mission of the agency and that tasks will be of a nature to justify awarding academic credit. All internships require prior approval, and all must consist of at least eight hours per week and at least 100 hours per semester. Students must sign an internship contract with their agency and faculty supervisors, setting out expectations and course requirements. Interns are required to keep a daily internship journal. Once approved for an internship, students enroll in PWAD 393, which is offered on a Pass/ Fail basis only and does not count toward the nine courses required for the major. Students wishing credit towards the major derived from their internship work should pursue an independent study with a faculty supervisor either while taking the internship or in the next semester. That independent study should produce a major written product, would be graded normally, and receives credit in the major. Study Abroad The curriculum encourages all undergraduates to study abroad either for a summer, a semester, or an entire year. Students should consult the study abroad (http://studyabroad.unc.edu) Web site and visit the Study Abroad Office as early as possible in their course of study to meet with a study abroad advisor. A number of foreign programs contain courses that qualify for major credit. Of particular usefulness is study at the King’s College, University of London War Studies Department, the closest analogue to the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense in the English- speaking world and a program with a renowned faculty. Students with at least a 3.3 grade point average are eligible to apply to King’s College. While supervision arrangements need to be negotiated and agreed with relevant faculty members, students writing honors theses in their senior year may also apply to spend the year at King’s College. Undergraduate Research Students who qualify are encouraged to experience original research by writing a senior honors thesis described in the honors section above.  \fDepartment of Philosophy Contact Information  Department of Philosophy http://philosophy.unc.edu Caldwell Hall, 240 East Cameron, CB# 3125 (919) 962-7291  Professor Mariska Leunissen, Director of Undergraduate Studies mariska@email.unc.edu  MARC LANGE, Chair  Introduction  The principal goal of the study of philosophy is to enable students to think more clearly, deeply, and appreciatively about themselves and their world. Study of philosophy enhances analytical, critical, and interpretive capacities that are applicable to any subject matter in almost any context. It provides many opportunities for expressing oneself, for reflecting on questions that human beings have pondered for millennia, for exchanging reasoned beliefs and engaging in focused debate, and for learning how to come to terms with problems for which there are no easy answers. A good philosophical education also helps to prepare students for responsible and intelligent participation in political and community affairs.  The most important outcome of philosophical study is the ability to engage in thinking that is at once disciplined and imaginatively creative. While such thinking lies at the heart of the philosophical enterprise, it is also needed for success in any complex intellectual or practical endeavor. Philosophy’s attention to critical thought, rigorous argument, and articulate expression makes the philosophical curriculum absolutely central to a liberal education and valuable as a basis for further training in a variety of pursuits.  Examples of philosophical questions are  • How should we understand truth, existence, validity, fact, value, free  will?  • What are the principles or presuppositions of science, language,  political systems, religious and moral views?  • What is the nature of a person, of space and time, of a work of art? • What is the wisdom of the past on these enduring questions? How  can we learn from people such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant?  Students are encouraged to view philosophy not as a specialized, esoteric discipline, but instead as an activity integral to a liberal arts education, helping students to think more cogently and appreciatively about themselves and their world.  PHIL 101, PHIL 110, or PHIL 112 is recommended as a first course for those interested in philosophical issues and their cultural significance and for those who wish to examine a broad range of philosophical topics, problems, or historical figures. Other good starting points are PHIL 155, which deals with logic and the analysis of argument; PHIL 160, which deals with moral thought and experience; and PHIL 150, which deals with the concepts, methods, and foundations of the biological and physical sciences.  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            667  PHIL 155 is recommended for all students who major or minor in philosophy.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  A major in philosophy offers excellent preparation for many careers in which clear thinking and analytical ability are valued. Some majors choose to pursue graduate work in philosophy in preparation for college or university teaching (Ph.D. normally required), but the philosophy major also provides the form of rigorous and systematic intellectual training that is of crucial importance in law, medicine, business, and other fields.

The study of matter and energy encompasses a range of phenomena, from the subnuclear to the cosmological. Physics seeks to understand the way the universe “works,” from the very small scale (quarks and neutrinos) to the human scale (materials encountered in daily life) to the structure of the cosmos. Different approaches and technologies are used in these different regimes.  The areas of active research at UNC–Chapel Hill can be divided into nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics, condensed matter and materials physics, field and particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics, and biophysics. Often the separation between subfields is not as distinct as it appears. For example, nuclear and particle physics are used to address questions in astrophysics. As scientists have learned more about the universe, they have realized that even the boundaries between the sciences have blurred. Today, physics shares interests with biology, chemistry, and computer science. Physicists are also responsible for the invention of much of our modern technology, including computers, lasers, medical imaging devices such as MRI and ultrasound, nuclear reactors, and the World Wide Web.  Physics has played a significant role in shaping modern society and culture, and some knowledge of physics is essential to fully appreciate the world. As the frontiers of physics and astronomy have advanced, old questions have been answered or refined, new questions have been asked, and major surprises have been encountered. The joy of doing physics is “To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower,  hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour” (William Blake).  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies and faculty advisors work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above). Faculty advisors are assigned to all physics majors and minors, and they assist students in a variety of physics related areas, including physics course planning, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, internships, career opportunities, and graduate school and fellowship applications. Physics majors are required to meet with their departmental advisor by appointment prior to registering for any semester beyond the fourth term in residence. Further information may be obtained from the department’s Web site under the Undergraduate Program (http://physics.unc.edu/undergraduate-program).  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Employers know that physicists understand how to think and reason effectively about the world, which equips them to solve unconventional challenging problems. Over 90 percent of physics majors do something other than teach and conduct research at a university. Physics will prepare you to pursue anything from medicine to energy to business. The American Institute of Physics’ Career Resources (http://aip.org/ career-resources) site provides useful information about the careers of physics bachelor’s degree recipients, including who is hiring them in North Carolina.  Those who are considering going on to graduate school in physics, astronomy, and other physical science and engineering fields, should contact one of the physics advisors. Those who are considering marine sciences as a graduate specialty should consult the material under the Department of Marine Sciences.

It requires an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 and a grade point average of at least 3.4 for physics courses at the end of the junior year.  Students who wish to enter the honors program should consult with the departmental coordinator for the program no later than the preregistration period in the spring semester of their junior year. Departmental Involvement The Society of Physics Students, open to anyone interested in physics, builds connections between undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and alumni. The society invites visitors to give talks and sponsors a number of events for students each year. Women in Physics at UNC– Chapel Hill, an organization that aims to provide resources, advice, and  an encouraging social atmosphere for women in the field of physics, welcomes physics majors and all women interested in physics. UNC–BEST The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate science majors interested in teaching high school science the opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students meet all the degree requirements for their degree using PHYS 410 as one of their upper-level physics courses. UNC–BEST students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester, students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601). For more details on admission requirements, application deadlines, and submitting an online application, visit the School of Education Web site: soe.unc.edu/academics/uncbest (http://soe.unc.edu/academics/uncbest). Undergraduate Awards The department gives awards each year to the senior (Shearin Award) and junior (Johnson Award) who demonstrate the greatest achievement. In addition, the department awards the major with the most research achievement the Robert Sheldon Award for Undergraduate Research. Undergraduate Research All majors conduct at least one semester of research under the supervision of a faculty member. Many enjoy the experience so much that they continue for several semesters. An approved learning contract is required prior to registering for PHYS 295 and PHYS 395, and students must be registered within the first week of classes.  Physics Major, B.S.

The study of matter and energy encompasses a range of phenomena, from the subnuclear to the cosmological. Physics seeks to understand the way the universe “works,” from the very small scale (quarks and neutrinos) to the human scale (materials encountered in daily life) to the structure of the cosmos. Different approaches and technologies are used in these different regimes.  Department Programs  Majors  • Physics Major, B.A. (p. 687) • Physics Major, B.S.

UNC–BEST students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689 or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester, students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593) and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601). For more details on admission requirements, application deadlines, and submitting an online application, visit the School of Education Web site: soe.unc.edu/academics/uncbest (http://soe.unc.edu/academics/uncbest). Undergraduate Awards The department gives awards each year to the senior (Shearin Award) and junior (Johnson Award) who demonstrate the greatest achievement. In addition, the department awards the major with the most research achievement the Robert Sheldon Award for Undergraduate Research. Undergraduate Research All majors conduct at least one semester of research under the supervision of a faculty member. Many enjoy the experience so much that they continue for several semesters. An approved learning contract is required prior to registering for PHYS 295 and PHYS 395, and students must be registered within the first week of classes.

GITTERMAN, Chair  Introduction  Public policy is an interdisciplinary social science major designed to provide students with the theoretical perspective, analytical skill, and substantive knowledge needed to respond to major domestic and global policy problems.  The core curriculum includes exposure to multiple disciplinary fields, including economics, political science, policy analysis, philosophy, research methods, and statistics.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Public Policy’s director of undergraduate studies and student services officer work with current and prospective students by appointment (see contact information above). For additional information on courses and undergraduate research opportunities, see the department''s Web site (http://publicpolicy.unc.edu/academics/undergraduate-program).  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  The undergraduate major in public policy provides students with conceptual and analytical skills that prepare them for work or graduate school. The integration of a liberal arts education, the development of writing and analytical abilities, and knowledge in a domestic or global policy field serves as the spring board for graduate work in many professions, including business, education, law, non-profit management, public administration, public health, public policy, public and international affairs and social work.

An honors course fulfills the same  requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment and GPA restrictions may apply.  Program Restrictions A maximum of one three-credit independent study course (PLCY 395, PLCY 396, PLCY 496, PLCY 596, or PLCY 696) may be counted as an elective for the policy major. A maximum of one three-credit transfer or study abroad course or two Burch Field Research Seminar in DC courses (PLCY 352H; HNRS 352) may be counted as electives toward the public policy major. For credit toward the major, an independent study proposal form must be completed by the student, approved by the independent study instructor, submitted to the student services officer, and approved by the director of undergraduate studies before the internship begins.  Special Opportunities in Public Policy Honors in Public Policy Public policy majors who have at least a 3.3 overall grade point and a 3.5 in the core public policy courses are eligible to apply to the department’s honors program in the spring of their junior year. The honors thesis offers an opportunity for motivated students to move beyond traditional coursework and apply critical thinking skills to an academic public policy thesis. This program is organized as an original, independent research project under the direction of a faculty adviser.  Completion of an honors thesis provides a total of six credit hours toward the major, including three credits toward a policy field concentration. Students who complete an honors thesis and maintain all other eligibility criteria may be recommended by their thesis advisor and the Undergraduate Affairs Committee for graduation with honors or highest honors in public policy. The department''s Web site (http:// publicpolicy.unc.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/honors) provides more information. Undergraduate Research Most courses in public policy include a research component.

PLCY 195, PLCY 393, PLCY 395, PLCY 581, PLCY 596, PLCY 691H, PLCY 692H, PLCY 696, and PLCY 698 are designated as research-intensive courses, and PLCY 460 and PLCY 581 are designated as research methods courses by the Office for Undergraduate Research. Earning a grade of C or better in any of these courses partially fulfills the requirements for the Carolina Research Scholar designation. The Duncan MacRae Jr. Public Policy Fund provides grants on a competitive basis to public policy majors engaged in mentored research with a public policy faculty member, in policy-relevant independent research, and in honors thesis research in public policy. Experiential Education In keeping with Carolina’s Making Connections Curriculum, the Department of Public Policy’s experiential education programs offer students structured, active-learning opportunities that invite them to integrate and apply their academic knowledge and skills in a real- world policy environment. Opportunities include internships, the Burch Field Research Seminar on Domestic and International Affairs in Washington DC, the public policy clinic (PLCY 393), and the public policy capstone course (PLCY 698). PLCY 130, PLCY 293, PLCY 393, PLCY 493, PLCY 691H, PLCY 692H, and PLCY 698 are all approved as experiential education courses.  For more information, see the department''s Web site (http:// publicpolicy.unc.edu/academics/experiential-education). Capstone Course The capstone course (PLCY 698) is the culminating experience of the public policy undergraduate major and is required for all seniors except those who complete an honors thesis. Students should register for the course in the fall or spring of their senior year. The course provides a bridge between policy analysis as it is studied in an academic setting and policy analysis as it is practiced in the workplace. Students work in small teams to produce actionable, client-centered, public policy analysis for a government agency or nonprofit organization. Internships Students may receive academic credit for an approved internship if it provides an academically relevant experience in policy analysis or research. Students who wish to complete an internship with an external organization can do so through PLCY 293 (available to public policy majors and minors). PLCY 293 is a Pass/Fail course.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Those wishing to proceed to graduate work in religious studies can consult the director of undergraduate studies. We encourage students to pursue the study of two or more languages in which the sacred literatures of the world have been written, as well as the modern languages of scholarship. In addition to the language courses offered by this department, UNC–Chapel Hill offers courses in Greek, Modern Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi-Urdu, Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit, Persian, Bengali, and Tamil.  Students majoring in religious studies often choose to pursue an M.A. or Ph.D. in religious studies or other related fields in the humanities and social sciences. Some of the graduates of the program go on to professional schools in law, medicine, divinity, or journalism. Each year the department awards a fellowship, the Bernard Boyd Fellowship, to a graduating religious studies major who is planning to pursue graduate study in religion at another institution.  Adjunct Associate Professors  Anna Bigelow (NCSU), Christian Lundberg, Barry Saunders, Margaret J. Wiener.  Adjunct Assistant Professors  Maria Doerfler (Duke University), Levi McLaughlin (NCSU).

Subjects in this department include: Religious Studies (RELI) (p. 737) and Jewish Studies (JWST) (p. 751)  The department offers a variety of courses ranging from large lecture classes to advanced seminars, as well as independent studies, an honors thesis program, and a capstone course for all majors (RELI 697). Introductory courses, which are numbered below 200, orient students to the field of religious studies or to major approaches, topics, or issues within that broader field. Intermediate courses are numbered between 200 and 399, and they provide more in-depth analysis. Advanced courses, which are numbered 400 and above, often build on knowledge or skills  \fderived from lower-level courses, and they provide opportunities for research-intensive study in particular areas of concentration in the study of religion.  RELI–Religious Studies Undergraduate-level Courses RELI 60. First-Year Seminar: Religion and Racism. 3 Credits. How does religion become a source of ethnic or racial prejudice among religious practitioners? When does prejudice against religious persons constitute a form of racism? This class explores answers to these questions by examining the connections between religion and racism in modern societies like the United States and South Africa. "

Our course offerings present a diversity of approaches—historical, literary, linguistic, sociopolitical, cultural, and theoretical—to the study of literary and nonliterary texts and cultures of Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Americas. Students acquire competence in the practice and analysis of Romance languages together with a critical knowledge of the written, oral, and visual traditions of their origin and diaspora. Our faculty promotes interdisciplinary connections and incorporates the study of literature, culture, theory, and history across the curriculum. Through coursework that emphasizes rhetoric, composition, and written and oral expression, our majors receive sustained personalized training in critical thinking and close reading.  Advising  All majors and minors can find their primary academic advisor in Dey Hall. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Each of the department’s language advisors will meet with current and prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http:// romancestudies.unc.edu).  Facilities  Students taking courses in the Department of Romance Studies have outstanding support for their work through the Language Resource Center (LRC), housed on the ground floor of Dey Hall. The LRC provides resources and services for language teaching and learning, including audio and video materials; smart classrooms with PCs and projection equipment; listening, viewing, and recording facilities; and online databases for language learning.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  The master of arts in teaching (M.A.T.) degree is intended for students who wish to teach at the secondary level. M.A. and Ph.D. programs in Romance languages are almost exclusively oriented toward literary studies, and the undergraduate student should prepare accordingly. A  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            769  reading knowledge of Latin is sometimes required, as is at least one other Romance language (generally Italian or Spanish). Useful allied disciplines are English, history, classics, philosophy, linguistics, and art history. A double major with one of these fields is often desirable. Faculty members can advise students on choices of graduate schools. Ratings of programs are published from time to time and are available through the department.  For students seeking careers in international business and law, journalism, publishing, social work, and the health professions, a second major or minor in a language is an asset. This also applies to students who wish to work in a field that makes knowledge of French, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish desirable, such as history, art, Latin American studies, or global studies.

The undergraduate major in sociology at UNC–Chapel Hill provides students with theoretical, methodological tools, and substantive insights for understanding human social life and institutions. The department’s faculty is particularly strong in the areas of social inequality, marriage and family, the life course and aging, work and the economy, religion, formal organizations, sex and gender, social movements, population and human ecology, poverty and welfare, medical sociology, social networks, education, and political sociology. Course themes range widely from the theoretical to the applied and incorporate a broad array of methodological approaches including comparative/historical, participant observation and interviewing, survey data collection and statistical analysis.  Management and society is an interdisciplinary major that focuses on the institutional context and inner workings of organizations. It prepares students for a variety of positions in private or public-sector organizations. Additionally, many students find the curriculum to be excellent preparation for a variety of business-oriented graduate and professional degree programs.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of undergraduate studies and assistant directors meet with current, transfer, and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information on the program page of the catalog). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those students who are double majors and those who may be considering going on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, writing an honors thesis, careers, and graduate schools is available on the department’s Web site.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Sociologists are employed by research institutes, public health and welfare organizations, social work agencies, private businesses, law firms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions, advertising firms, survey and polling organizations, and the criminal justice system. Others work in politics and government and in community and social justice organizing.  A major in sociology also prepares students for law, medical, or business school and for graduate degree programs in social work, education, public policy, religious ministry, mass communications, public health, nonprofit administration, and international affairs. Of course the  sociology major also prepares interested undergraduates for graduate studies in sociology, should they choose to continue in the field to become researchers or teachers in high schools, two- or four-year colleges, or research universities. Students interested in pursuing graduate studies in sociology after college may, with the instructor’s permission, enroll in graduate-level courses at UNC–Chapel Hill.  A major in management and society prepares students for virtually any aspect of a business career that does not involve highly specialized training (such as finance and accounting). Employers are interested in students who can think on their feet, communicate effectively, write well, and make sense of the social and economic changes occurring in their industry. Management and society majors are educated in each of these skills.  Graduates with B.A. degrees with majors in management and society are especially suited for entry-level positions in any aspect of human resource management, industry, or public sector organizations. Among recent graduates who responded to a placement office survey, the largest number were employed in sales; management or management training positions with at least some supervisory or personnel-related responsibilities ranked second. Other graduates are working in customer service, purchasing, and marketing research, and several hold positions in the public sector.

Students who are not contacted, especially double majors, transfer students, and students who declare their major in sociology relatively late in their college careers, are encouraged to speak with their major advisor or the department’s honors advisor no later than the preregistration period during the second semester of their junior year.  To graduate with honors in sociology, a major must meet the following requirements:  • At least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average in major courses and all  courses taken at the University  • Completion of an honors thesis based on independent study, which may involve collection of data by the student, under the supervision of a faculty thesis advisor  • Participation in an honors seminar program during the fall and spring  semesters of the senior year.  Students may receive credit for one or both senior honors research and seminar courses (SOCI 691H and SOCI 692H) depending on the extent of their thesis work.  For more information on honors, contact Professor Howard Aldrich (howard_aldrich@unc.edu), CB# 3210, 202 Hamilton Hall, (919) 962-5044. Honors in Management and Society A student may, as a result of distinguished work (3.3 grade point average or higher), be awarded a degree with honors or highest honors. This requires completion of a senior honors thesis. Interested students should contact the management and society office for more information. Honors students should enroll in MNGT 691H and MNGT 692H. MNGT 692H will fulfill one of the course requirements from the social context of business group listed above. Student Clubs The Sociology Club is a student-run, student-driven organization that may provide relevant presentations, discussions, guidance, and/or service opportunities in sociology. The Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) is a student-run, student-driven organization that may provide relevant presentations, discussions, guidance, and/or service and intern opportunities in management and society. Independent Study and Reading SOCI 396 may be taken for one to three hours of course credit depending on the amount of academic work planned by the student. It is usually taken by juniors and seniors who have completed at least two or three courses in sociology. Students may use independent study to  • Do reading and research in an area in which no course is offered • Take advanced or more specialized coursework in a specific area of  sociology  After an area of study has been selected, the student contacts a faculty member in the department whose interests are in or related to the topic area. If the faculty member agrees to direct the student’s independent study, the student needs final approval by the department’s director of undergraduate studies. It is the student’s and faculty supervisor’s  \f812         Management and Society Major, B.A.  responsibility to determine the amount of reading and/or outside work to be done, the frequency with which the student’s progress will be assessed, and the papers or examinations that will constitute the course requirements. An approved learning contract is necessary, and some written work involving sociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI 396. Students must sign up for SOCI 396 before the end of the first week of classes. Independent Experiential Internship Students may combine employment and study in the form of an internship program for which they receive one to three academic credits through SOCI 393. The student must assume responsibility for employment arrangements. Students may not receive credit for paid employment. The student contacts a faculty member in the department whose interests are in or related to the area of the internship. If the faculty member agrees to direct the internship, the student needs final approval by the department’s director of undergraduate studies. Credit is not provided for the internship alone; some written work involving sociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI 393. Because of the expectation that students doing an internship for academic credit will conduct substantive sociological analysis, it is very important that planning begin early. Students must secure all approvals for the contract before the first day of the internship. Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award The Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award is presented yearly to a graduating senior who has displayed excellence in undergraduate sociological achievement. This award was established in 1967 in honor of Professor Howard Odum, who founded and first chaired the UNC– Chapel Hill Department of Sociology. Odum was a pioneer in American sociology and a major influence on the discipline. The department faculty selects the recipient of the annual award on the basis of grade records and other demonstrations of academic talent and accomplishment as an undergraduate. Undergraduate Research Students interested in working with faculty on their research projects should contact the Office for Undergraduate Research for more information and also speak with the director of undergraduate studies.  Management and Society Major, B.A. Contact Information  Department of Sociology http://www.unc.edu/depts/soc 155 Hamilton Hall, CB# 3210 (919) 962-1007  Michael Dunn, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies mikewill@live.unc.edu  Management and society is an interdisciplinary major that focuses on the institutional context and inner workings of organizations. It prepares students for a variety of positions in private or public-sector organizations. Additionally, many students find the curriculum to be excellent preparation for a variety of business-oriented graduate and professional degree programs.  The phrase “management and society” in its broadest sense encompasses not only direct dealings between management and organized labor but also matters such as governmental policy, industrial psychology, industrial sociology, personnel administration, and worker  education. A broad knowledge and understanding of economics, history, sociology, psychology, communications, and political science are essential. Work in this field also requires knowledge of techniques such as statistics, administrative practices, testing and measurement, and guidance and counseling. Majors acquire an understanding of the conceptual foundations and principles of interpersonal and institutional relations and of the ways these principles can be applied in the work place. General areas of study are employer-employee relations, development of human resources, and the institutional context of work.  Some students have combined management and society with concentrations in such academic disciplines as economics, sociology, psychology, public policy, history, and political science.

Some of the core courses are cross-listed. Special Note for Economics Double Majors Double majors in economics and management and society may take ECON 430 instead of ECON 330, ECON 445 instead of ECON 345, and ECON 480 instead of ECON 380.  Special Opportunities in Sociology and Management and Society Honors in Sociology The department attempts to identify and invite all qualified students to participate in the senior honors program. Students who are not contacted, especially double majors, transfer students, and students who declare their major in sociology relatively late in their college careers, are encouraged to speak with their major advisor or the department’s honors advisor no later than the preregistration period during the second semester of their junior year.  To graduate with honors in sociology, a major must meet the following requirements:  • At least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average in major courses and all  courses taken at the University  • Completion of an honors thesis based on independent study, which may involve collection of data by the student, under the supervision of a faculty thesis advisor  • Participation in an honors seminar program during the fall and spring  semesters of the senior year.  Students may receive credit for one or both senior honors research and seminar courses (SOCI 691H and SOCI 692H) depending on the extent of their thesis work.  For more information on honors, contact Professor Howard Aldrich (howard_aldrich@unc.edu), CB# 3210, 202 Hamilton Hall, (919) 962-5044. Honors in Management and Society A student may, as a result of distinguished work (3.3 grade point average or higher), be awarded a degree with honors or highest honors. This requires completion of a senior honors thesis. Interested students should contact the management and society office for more information. Honors students should enroll in MNGT 691H and MNGT 692H. MNGT 692H will fulfill one of the course requirements from the social context of business group listed above. Student Clubs The Sociology Club is a student-run, student-driven organization that may provide relevant presentations, discussions, guidance, and/or service opportunities in sociology. The Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) is a student-run, student-driven organization that may provide relevant presentations, discussions, guidance, and/or service and intern opportunities in management and society. Independent Study and Reading SOCI 396 may be taken for one to three hours of course credit depending on the amount of academic work planned by the student. It is usually taken by juniors and seniors who have completed at least two or three courses in sociology. Students may use independent study to  3 3  3 3 6  3  3 3 3 3 3  48  \f814         Social and Economic Justice Minor  • Do reading and research in an area in which no course is offered • Take advanced or more specialized coursework in a specific area of  sociology  After an area of study has been selected, the student contacts a faculty member in the department whose interests are in or related to the topic area. If the faculty member agrees to direct the student’s independent study, the student needs final approval by the department’s director of undergraduate studies. It is the student’s and faculty supervisor’s responsibility to determine the amount of reading and/or outside work to be done, the frequency with which the student’s progress will be assessed, and the papers or examinations that will constitute the course requirements. An approved learning contract is necessary, and some written work involving sociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI 396. Students must sign up for SOCI 396 before the end of the first week of classes. Independent Experiential Internship Students may combine employment and study in the form of an internship program for which they receive one to three academic credits through SOCI 393. The student must assume responsibility for employment arrangements. Students may not receive credit for paid employment. The student contacts a faculty member in the department whose interests are in or related to the area of the internship. If the faculty member agrees to direct the internship, the student needs final approval by the department’s director of undergraduate studies. Credit is not provided for the internship alone; some written work involving sociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI 393. Because of the expectation that students doing an internship for academic credit will conduct substantive sociological analysis, it is very important that planning begin early. Students must secure all approvals for the contract before the first day of the internship. Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award The Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award is presented yearly to a graduating senior who has displayed excellence in undergraduate sociological achievement. This award was established in 1967 in honor of Professor Howard Odum, who founded and first chaired the UNC– Chapel Hill Department of Sociology. Odum was a pioneer in American sociology and a major influence on the discipline. The department faculty selects the recipient of the annual award on the basis of grade records and other demonstrations of academic talent and accomplishment as an undergraduate. Undergraduate Research Students interested in working with faculty on their research projects should contact the Office for Undergraduate Research for more information and also speak with the director of undergraduate studies.

Particular areas in which graduates can obtain employment or continue with graduate study include Statistics Probability and statistics are two of the most frequently applied areas in the mathematical decision sciences. Students in this area study the mathematical theories of probability and statistics and their application to mathematical models that contain an element of uncertainty or randomness. Opportunities for employment are manifold in businesses and government agencies dealing with many branches of the natural and social sciences, including pharmacology, environmental sciences, and many others. Operations Research In this area, students study mathematical and statistical techniques related to decision making. This branch of the mathematical decision sciences is crucial in business, government, and other management areas where difficult problems that depend on large amounts of data are addressed (for example, complex airline route schedules). In addition to their major courses, students interested in this field are encouraged to take courses in business and economics. Actuarial Science Actuaries are mathematicians who work primarily in businesses that involve financial risk, including the insurance industry. Students interested in this field take advanced courses in statistics, stochastic processes, and the mathematical theory of risk.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. After contacting the mathematical decision sciences office (see “Contact Information” above), all majors and minors are also assigned an undergraduate advisor in the department. The department’s undergraduate advisors discuss course planning with current majors and, if needed, minors  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            817  before registration each semester. The director of undergraduate studies works with prospective majors and minors by appointment. Additional information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http://www.stat-or.unc.edu) or by contacting the director of undergraduate studies.  Courses for Students from Other Departments  The Department of Statistics and Operations Research offers a variety of courses of potential value to students majoring in other disciplines. Introductory courses include STOR 113 and STOR 215, which are foundation courses in decision models, and the basic statistical courses, STOR 151 and STOR 155. At the intermediate level, STOR 305 provides an introduction to business decision models, while STOR 471 is an introductory course in actuarial science. Substantial coverage of applied statistical methods is provided in STOR 455 and STOR 556. At more advanced mathematical levels, an introduction to probability theory is provided by STOR 435, and the basic theory of statistical inference is given by STOR 555. More advanced deterministic and stochastic models of operations research are provided in STOR 415 and STOR 445.  Graduate School and Career Opportunities  Regardless of the electives chosen, the mathematical decision sciences degree program provides excellent preparation for graduate study. Graduates with concentrations in operations research or statistics often continue work at the graduate level in those fields or related areas such as industrial engineering, biostatistics, and environmental science, or enter business school to pursue the master’s in business administration (M.B.A.) degree.  A five-year B.S.–M.S. degree program in operations research is also an option. This program is under the direction of the Department of Statistics and Operations Research. Interested students should consult the program director.  Graduates in the mathematical decision sciences will find numerous opportunities for well-paid, challenging jobs.

Interested students should consult the program director.  Special Opportunities in Mathematical Decision Sciences Honors in Mathematical Decision Sciences Candidates for honors or highest honors must secure approval from the program director. They must take STOR 691H and STOR 692H, and maintain an overall grade point average of 3.3 and a grade point average in mathematical decision sciences courses of at least 3.3 at the end of the semester preceding the semester in which they graduate. Departmental Involvement The mathematical decision sciences program sponsors Carolina’s Actuarial Student Organization (CASO), for students interested in a career in the actuarial sciences. CASO organizes study groups for the actuarial exams, sponsors talks by professional actuaries, keeps members aware of employment opportunities, and maintains contact with alumni and corporations in the field. Experiential Education When arranged in advance with a supervising faculty member, STOR 493 can be used to earn credit for appropriate work experience in the summer or during the academic year. STOR 493 satisfies the experiential education requirement. Students interested in STOR 493 should secure approval from the program director before starting their work. STOR 496 can also be used to satisfy the experiential education requirement. Undergraduate Awards Two undergraduate awards for graduating seniors are given each year by the mathematical decision sciences program. One is the Mathematical Decision Sciences Award, given to the outstanding graduating senior, and the second is the W. Robert Mann Award, given for excellence in actuarial science. Plaques bearing the names of winners are located in the undergraduate study room in Hanes Hall. Undergraduate Research Undergraduate research under the direction of faculty members from the Department of Statistics and Operations Research is offered through the independent study and research course, STOR 496, and the senior honors thesis courses, STOR 691H and STOR 692H.

Students will be exposed to recent scholarship on feminist theory and the intellectual, economic, political, and artistic contributions of women and feminist movements in various historical and cultural contexts.  Approximately 30 departments offer over 120 courses that focus on the study of women and/or gender. Many of these courses have been cross- listed as women’s and gender studies courses and are identified below; others are taught as special sections of an established course and are identified separately each semester.  Advising  All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students whose first major is women’s and gender studies are also required to meet with a faculty member in the department before they can register. All other majors and minors are strongly encouraged to meet with a faculty member as well. The department’s director of undergraduate studies also works with current and prospective majors and minors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. All students are encouraged to review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http://womensstudies.unc.edu).
